As you both point out, there are aspects of human evolution that are artificial but still plenty of natural ones too. For example, infectious disease is one majore way that we''re still affected. Although we have vaccines against smallpox and other detrimental diseases, others still plague us. For example the flu and HIV are two different viruses that kill people who can''t survive them. Our gene pool has responded accordingly, and in northern europe there are alleles of genes (the CCR5 gene) that make people resistant to HIV (and also the bubonic plague). Though it''s a trade-off (as all alleles usually are) and that same allele makes one more susceptible to west nile virus.\n\nThe main point is that both natural and artificial selection are evolution; humans are subject to both.', '15 Jun ''13, 19:35', '100071227'),

Does any of the various universal claims of psychology apply to Masai tribesmen of africa? Has it been so tested.\n\nWhen I took psychology courses much was made of the phenomenon of "wilding", where humans (black teens actually) would get together in packs like wolves and attack innocent white women, all based on the Central Park Jogger case. This, and input from psychologists about the dynamics of this, created a moral panic and much racism towards and perceived need to control and limit the freedom of minority teens.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_Jogger_case\n\nWhen it was found that the kids were all tortured by forensic psychologists into false confessions and the rape was committed by one adult acting alone, psychology textbooks merely dropped that chapter rather than admitting to the long history of failures and intense damage to society and people that the field has caused, with no failures ever admitted, but instead buried and whitewashed.\n\nSeveral classes I took discussed the danger of black teen "wilding", where humans loose their humanity in "packs", emphasizing through the word "packs" and the psychological theory pushed how minority youth are animal like and barely human. Never is the parallel phenomenon discussed where adult white soldiers, working under orders, and with the approval of their culture, commit violent war atrocities such as in Iraq and Afghanistan discussed. Instead it is always young black teens that must be discussed, in a single case that never happened.\n\nHere in this class we are already talking about the case where a bunch of people didn''t do anything when a women was raped and killed. It''s this same one case that is always discussed over and over.

Evolution is "change" and change is a description of many facts. So, Evolution is not a fact, it is a body of knowledge. If I fall, it hurts. If I throw something it tends to land. These are facts and measured. Then those facts are put together to describe the shared behavior, which we call gravity. Gravitational Theory is large and contains a number of facts, but also a number of things that are conditional on whether new evidence will change the understanding. Evolution Theory has many facts and a number of assertions are conditional on whether new evidence will change the understanding.\n\nUnfortunately, any discussion of evolution leads to the cultural dichotomy of Evolution vs Intelligent Design. This is a false dichotomy. If quantum physics and technology give us better understanding of how the smallest elements of energy work within a framework to create new substances or change existing substances, the mechanism will include observable facts and then the facts will create a set of beliefs about what those facts means.

Some find comfort in a godless world based on impersonal rules of chemistry and some find comfort in a personal hand behind the mechanisms. Neither of these can be proven with science, only interpreted by people. Stronger personalities will try to persuade others and solitify their certainty.\n\nI try not to get bogged down in the rhetoric as much as remind myself that science is always under pressure to find solutions to problems and eventually a paradigm shift occurs and the whole understanding changes. Being humble means understanding history and knowing that where we are now is not the end of where things are going. Neither is science the answer to meaning in our lives. We still have to choose for ourselves how we will live in the time we have. We will always teeter between certainty and uncertainty in everything we do. Psychology will probably look at this, but it is within Systems Theory, so probably more sociology, though I am looking for it in this class. :) (Sorry this is so long and cheers!)', '29 Jun ''13, 17:40', '100079162'),

This part is most troubling to me because the therapy being administered becomes less genuine unbeknownst to the patients.\n\nThe monetary incentive to see someone for a short period of time (15-20min), hold steady/increase/decrease/refill a prescription seems like it would be more profitable than to conduct talk therapy for one person.  \n\nIn the time it takes to conduct one talk therapy session, the same psychiatrist can see three to four different people.  From the NYT article: " A psychiatrist can earn $150 for three 15-minute medication visits compared with $90 for a 45-minute talk therapy session."\n\nAlso from the NYT article is the disturbing statistic from a government survey that states that only 11% (and declining) of psychiatrists provide talk therapy to all patients.\n\nAs you stated, "A trained psychologist should know to take many factors and context into account when making a diagnosis such as home life, social life, or classroom."  I completely agree.  However, the I feel as though the rater (the trained psychiatrist) reliability becomes poor when he or she cannot ( for lack of coverage on behalf of the patients insurance provider, or even conflict of interest ) form a sound judgement about a personality or dysfunction to personality without extended time spent with a patient.\n\nAs for the 20 internet tabs, texting, ipod stuff, I have to disagree.  Again, as I stated earlier, we typically over-prescribe medications compared to other industrialized nations - the same type of nations that probably have ipods, web browsers, and text messaging.  \n\nSo what''s so fundamentally different between our industrialized nation and the others?\nFor starters, this may or may not come to you as a shock but we (I assume you''re in the US) are the only industrialized nation to allow pharmaceutical companies to directly advertise to consumers.  \n\nThis also may or may not come to you as a shock but John Watson, you may remember him from our studies regarding classical conditioning and the Little Albert study, took refuge in the advertising industry post-academia.  Others have followed suit as well.   There''s a lot of psychology (and money) involved in marketing - priming, appealing to emotions, manipulating thoughts - all aimed at parting consumers from their money.\n\nHeck, as you walk into a super market, the first thing you''ll probably see is produce.  There''s a marketing reason for that - it primes the consumer into associating fresh food with the rest of the goods in the store.  \n\nAt any rate, marketing, pharmaceutical advertisements and an alarming trend of decreasing talk therapy, and increasing prescriptions is troubling to me.  I apologize if this wasn''t coherent.  \n\nTin foil hat aside, I''m interested in hearing what our instructors think about this topic.', '09 Aug ''13, 00:51', '100101529'),

This most likely influences my own thoughts on marriage that I can wait and don''t have any type of set age goal for getting married. I want to have a successful career and be able to take care of myself completely before even thinking about getting married. It'' a huge commitment to somebody else for the rest of your life (50% of the time). At this point I don''t even know myself well enough to know what I want in 5 years, let alone WHO I''d want in 5 years. Looking back 5 years ago, I was a totally different person and I accept that I''ll change between now and 5 years from now.\nThe marriage age has probably been shifting because of how socially acceptable it is and how difficult it is. It was expected for people to get married young in the 50''s and start families, to become the perfect American family. It''s much different now where we hold careers, higher education, and independence at a higher priority than having a family. It''s more acceptable in the present day to be alone with a successful job or fulfilling career, opposed to in the 50''s they''d wonder if the person had a problem if they didn''t get married.\nBeing ready to get married is highly subjective. I''d want to fully believe I could commit to that person for the rest of my life, be able to have a comfortable life together, and feel that they want the same things. There has to be no question that you''d want to spend the rest of your life with them, that they''re the best person for you.

In acoustics, this level is well accepted, so it is quite common not to reference it. I just looked it up, and the reference pressure you mention is the default used in air, but there is another one in water.\nThe teachers got it right in that they equate the amplitude with pressure. What they call volume in technical terms would be termed sound intensity, and it relates to pressure as intensity=pressure^2/rho/c where rho the density of air and c the speed of sound actually. This statement is actually not correct either because the same dB value at sea level and on top of a mountain (with rho only half that at seal level) correspond to a factor of two change in Intensity.\nWhat seems to confuse students more is the nature of the logarithmic scale. It also seems to have thrown the instructors as they confuse the log base 10 with log base 2 (which is a bit odd as the only field I have seen log base 2 much is in computer algorithms). I think the point they try to make is that the sound intensity changes by a constant factor with every 10dB of sound intensity.', '22 Sep ''13, 17:29', NULL),

I mentioned the Manning et al article for a reason. They draw a distinction between the actual events (which they feel do not display evidence of the bystander effect in the way that it is defined in psychological research) with the "Parable of the 38 Witnesses."\n\nIt is not a matter of some minor details being wrong. The main point of the story is wrong. But it is these "details" which gave the story its power. Saying that there were 38 eye witnesses is a lot more powerful than saying that there were really just 6. The eye witnesses seeing 3 attacks is a lot more powerful than saying that a handful of people saw part of the first attack, but could not have seen the second. Saying that no one did anything is a lot more powerful than saying that they drove off Moseley, someone called the police and they saw that Kitty was able to walk away. Saying that they knew she was being stabbed is more powerful than saying that no one knew that Moseley had a knife and they all thought it was a domestic dispute.\n\nYes, there was a tragic murder. In the Parable of the 38 Witnesses it happened because of the bystander effect/bystander apathy. In what actually happened (according to the research of Manning et al, using court documents, statements from the DA at the time, and other sources) the main problem was that people did not understand the severity of the situation. The six people who saw any part of either attack thought that they were witnessing a domestic disturbance and behaved accordingly. They made sure the man was chased away (he drove off in his car) and that the woman was able to get up and walk away (albeit very slowly). At least one of them called the police. The police also thought it was no big deal, so they were very slow to respond. Tragic? Absolutely. But not understanding the severity of the situation is different from understanding the severity of the situation yet failing to act because you assume someone else will. The latter is the bystander effect. The former, while tragic, is not.', '09 Oct ''13, 16:13', '100116026'),

However, I am a biologist/geneticist and think I can clarify the current consensus.\n\nRemember that your ability to think/reason depends on a complex network of neurons (and other cell types) that make up your brain. This complex organ is developed extensively during embryonic development and continues to grow and change during childhood, responding dramatically to hormones at puberty, and reaching stability finally around the age of 25.\n\nThe methods we have for measuring intelligence are imperfect, but IQ is one method of examining higher order cognition (the ability to reason/think). There are people with extremely high IQs, those with incredibly low IQs, and most somewhere in the middle. Although it can be difficult to differentiate what genetic/physiological/environmental differences distinguish a person with an average IQ from a person with a high IQ, there have been many studies demonstrating clear defects that would differentiate someone with a very low IQ from those with an average or high IQ. \n\nFor example, Fragile X mental retardation is "a spectrum of intellectual disabilities ranging from mild to severe" (wiki ref). "Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat affecting the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a failure to express the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal neural development." Mutations in the FMR1 gene cause all sorts of developmental defects that affect intelligence. Exactly how this occurs is not fully known, but lots has been learned by modeling the disease in the fruit fly. You can learn more about Fragile X Syndrome here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome#Neurological\n\nand more about the fruit fly model here:\n\nhttp://modencode.sciencemag.org/drosophila/autism/\n\nSo this is a clear example of how genetics affects intelligence. Science researchers are learning more about the genetic basis of intelligence all the time. In fact, IQ has a relatively high heritability (indicating that the variation in intelligence seen in the human population can be explained largely by genetics). \n\nHOWEVER, there are plenty of environmental factors that affect intelligence, but many are likely to be most effective if their action occurs during embryonic development, when the foundation of the brain is being laid down. I don''t have any specifics to cite about this.\n\nThis is a very gray area, and like most traits, both genetics and environment play a role in intelligence; but be wary of placing too much emphasis on the environmental factors - there is a lot of hidden privilege and societal factors that are responsible for moderate variation in IQ between individuals in a population. Each case must be examined individually and with extreme attention to detail.', '29 May ''14, 18:52', '100186525'),

For example, men not being as nuturing as women with babies and small children is probably more to do about society than genetics. \n\nAs for homosexuality, I also wonder how much that is to with culture, because countries like Thailand where homosexuality is more accepted or even respected there also SEEM to be more homosexuals. A lot more people have homosexual tendencies, maybe just fantasies,  than they admit so maybe in those societies people experiment more are find it more comfortable. Especially as relationships and experimentations are so severerly restricted before marriage. In single sex schools you get only visual stimulus from other males and as I understand, visual stimulus is much bigger in sexual arousal for men than it is for women.

('ud585', 'Intro to iOS App Development with Swift', 'In this course we will build an iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This course will introduce you to iOS app development in Swift, a new programming language from Apple, and serves as your launching point into the iOS Developer Nanodegree. Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple''s Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions: Why is the language called Swift? The language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read.  Should I learn Swift or Objective-C? Swift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you wont miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code. How easy is Swift to learn? Swift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. According to Apple, Swift is the first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. Some have even called Swift the new BASIC. Is it fast? Apple boasts that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user. Why did Apple decide to create a new language? Objective-C has been Apples primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware. Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store? Absolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched. Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift? As mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show its age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware. How Stable is Swift? As with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release. The thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: failable initializers. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the revision history for The Swift Programming Language. What other languages is it similar to? Swift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though youll also probably recognize some C syntax.  Is it compatible with iOS 6 &amp; 7? Swift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.'),

We repeatedly fall prey to believing in untrue assertions just because we can''t think it through. e.g . "I wore these pants in exam, I got good grades. I tried it again, I again got good grades. To check, I tried wearing different paints, and I failed. Therefore, the pants cause/correlate with good grades." First of all, one can''t be sure about strong enough correlation without a good experimental study, and even then causation isn''t guaranteed. Then, there are biases like confirmation biases. Because of all such shortcomings we have, pseudosciences like astrology, homeopathy and other "alternative" medicine, climate change denial, and 9/11 truth movement are thriving.

The study protocol is flawed in that it uses smiles as a proxy for happiness without evidence that that is a reasonable substitution. The study also fails to define happiness beyond smiles. Smiles can convey many things, including deception, resentment, and attempts at seduction, or to cover lying. It is likely there is little correlation at all between smiles and happiness, and any correlation positive or negative is deeply contextual and also culturally dependent. Many happy people do not smile very often. Many people who often wear smiles are in a deep state of melancholy. Look at racist tropes in advertising and films of the 1800s and 1900s. Here we see American Indian and African American people represented with huge smiles as caricatures  - to make them seem more subservient, more submissive and less threatening. Smiles are often expected of service personal, slaves, the disenfranchised people and those with little power in a society. It is not unsurprising if people with little power in a work situation are required to smile and pretend to appreciate being subjected to insincere or abusive gestures from those in power who expect them to give the appearance of happy compliant worker bees.

Someone experiencing depression is grappling with feelings of severe despair over an extended period of time. Almost every aspect of their life can be affected, including their emotions, physical health, relationships and work. For people with depression, it does not feel like there is a light at the end of the tunnel  there is just a long, dark tunnel."  I still feel as if people are in control of their own emotions and that the only cure to depression is changing how you think into a more positive way. Many forms of therapy for depression pretty much explain in different ways that this is a "cure" to it...by simply altering the way you think about things. In my eyes I have a hard time empathizing for people who are "depressed" because I feel anyone can allow themselves to become depressed and it is in your own control not to allow that to happen.

I have since been using the principles of operant conditioning from everything to training my pets, to training myself! I strongly believe that knowing how operant conditioning works we can change our lives for the better. We can also see why behavior occurs at certain times and why it does not at other times. All of this information can help us make sense of our world. In this lesson, we were able to see the incredible power of operant conditioning principles in action with Dr. Zeligs at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. I hope that you enjoy seeing how the consequences of our behaviors influence the likelihood of those behaviors occurring in the future and how powerful those consequences can be.  Also, do not let my excitement for operant conditioning overshadow my enthusiasm for classical conditioning and social learning. These two areas of learning also go a long way to help us explain why behavior occurs. Taken together, the material on classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning should provide you with insight into how and why behavior occurs! I look forward to hearing your comments on this lesson!\nBest,\nDr. Snycerski  ', 'users/118578353/susan-snycerski', '01 Jul ''13, 20:46', 124, 1, 0),

It also reports that there can be a phase of positive ''arousal'' between heart rate of 110 to 145 beats per minute during which the body withdraws from other tasks and focuses our senses only on the immediate goal and after that limit if it happens it may lead to bad results as the body closes too much of our senses and we are not even able to match our right hand with our left hand.\nIndeed, sometimes I have also experienced this feeling while playing when we are largely focused on the game.\nIs it a state of half consciousness or what?

There is also a social expectation that the oldest child will care for the parents and the family in general.

Can I add some thoughts: this was a very nicely produced course with good variety of input styles and some interesting guests too. I liked the interactive slides where we had to answer a question, or think about something.  Just a few things needed to be ''tweaked'' - the accuracy of the language (grammar and spelling mostly) needs work. Spelling mistakes, and so on, can be forgiven once or twice, but there were bloopers in almost every session. Secondly, the tests were not always well-designed, either in the instructions (sometimes completely absent on some questions!) or in the design of the question itself.  I guess this was all due to the fact that a) it was the first time you''d done this course b) you didn''t really have enough time to be careful. We all lead busy lives.

As far as I know meditation is pure observation. Many people think that meditation is controlling their thoughts. Struggling with them, getting them away and so on. Forcing deep breaths will bring peace and quiet into our minds (I would rather say it awakes peace and quiet in mind; we cannot bring anything inside, because we are full of everything yet :) ). It can be named as relaxation. Relevant phase before true meditation. Now, when we are calm, meditating will be simplier. As it said, one should sit comfortably. Can be in lotus position, but for the beginning of this way it is good to sit like on chair (try to not lean). Keep our back straight. Close your eyes. And focus on your breath. Do not try to change the rhythm! Let breathing to be effortless. Inhale. Exhale. There is no need to control anything. It sounds simple, isn''t it? One can have interrupting thoughts. They can form sounds, images and movies. The key is not to get rid of them, but to let them exist under your observation. Observe them. Be aware of them. Whenever an image comes to your mind, focus on breath. Concentrating on breath will ''melt'' this thoughts.  We, people, are being taught of controlling everything. Other people, our behavior, animals and so. We attempt to do so with thoughts. Struggling with them is an option, but then we are focusing on them, which isn''t proper. Giving them attention just increases the volume of them. Observing, letting them come and go, will produce wonderful effects. Effortlessly.  I think I would call this being mindful.

However, even though she didn''t yell for help infront of a lot of people, no-one came to her rescue. From what we have studied about the bystander effect, calling for help from one or two sources should have increased her chances of getting help, which of-course didn''t happen. Now, I know that the lack of help can be attributed to the callous nature of the individual she might have called, but still the event does tell us that it might not be completely useless to yell or ask for help from multiple sources in-case of an emergency. So, just for the sake of sharing and discussion, this particular event goes against what we have learned about the bystander effect and the increased chances of getting help if a lesser number of people hear our cry for help.', 'users/100020046/code_jamer', '16 Aug ''13, 23:42', 275, 2, 1),

You can receive a medically prescribed hallucination making you think your life was just wonderful so you can die happy. I also have issues with the quest for the "mystical experience". Zen monks train for years to attain samadhi. But what is really accomplished in the end? Is the state of transcendence just a mental illusion/delusion?

If we feel pain in a certain body part - a sign that the physical integrity of the body is in danger -  then the corresponding neural assembly is activated by excitatory connections, and at the same time deactivated by inhibitory connections, which results in an overall loss of flow. The same pattern occurs on a more abstract level if we lose a person.

He starts by saying that Margaret Clark, Judson Mills and Alan Fiske were right when they said we live simultaneously in two different worlds, one where social norms prevail and other where the market norms rule. The social norms are things we do for other people without wanting a reward.  Like helping with a heavy object or holding a door open. This kind of situations is a source of pleasure for both sides, so we do such things without thinking about a reward or something similar. The market norms are different. We are always doing things for the rewards. (Maybe the relationship between a job and a payment check is a good example.) We are always measuring the cost/benefits of our actions and trying to take advantage of them. The most interesting part of the chapter comes when he tells about the experiments made about mixing these worlds up. For example: When you offer a small amount of money for something that could be done as favor, people tend to refuse the task they would do for free. Using pure logic this makes absolutely no sense. You could think that doing a favor plus some money is always better than doing a favor for no money at all, but this is not how things work.', 'users/105298481/bonifacio', '18 Sep ''13, 17:35', 372, 0, 0),

('100121447', 'Do not blame the cats unfairly', 'Intro to Psychology - Lesson 15 Psychological Disorders - Risk factors for schizophrenia', 'Experts estimate that about half of toxoplasmosis infections are caused by eating raw or undercooked infected meat, but you can also get the parasite by eating unwashed contaminated produce, drinking contaminated water, or handling contaminated soil, cat litter, or meat and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Toxoplasmosis can''t be transmitted from person to person, with the exception of transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy or from an infected blood transfusion or organ transplant. Do I have to get rid of my cat? No. You''ve probably heard that cat feces are a major source of toxoplasmosis, but that doesn''t mean you need to get rid of your beloved pet. You''ll want to take some extra precautions, though. Here''s the scoop on how cats can become infected and transmit the infection. Felines are a natural host for the parasite, and it reproduces in their intestines. A cat may become infected with toxoplasmosis from eating infected prey or undercooked meat, or by drinking unpasteurized milk or contaminated water. The parasites then form "oocysts" in the cat''s gut, and the cat excretes millions of these oocysts daily for up to three weeks. (Oocysts can''t be seen with the naked eye, and in most cases you''ll have no idea that your cat is sick.) The oocysts become infectious 24 hours or so after they''re excreted. Under the right conditions, they can live in the soil, sand, or litter and remain infectious for up to 18 months. During this time, they spread, contaminating water, fruits, and vegetables, and infecting warm-blooded species, including humans, that come in contact with them and ingest them. So while it''s possible to get infected with toxoplasma oocytes from direct contact with cat feces (such as handling the litter of a newly infected cat), you can also be exposed to oocytes elsewhere  while gardening, eating unwashed vegetables, or drinking contaminated water, for instance. see more....http://www.babycenter.com/0_toxoplasmosis-during-pregnancy_1461.bc?page=2', 'users/117855531/nikoletta-2', '17 Oct ''13, 05:13', 100, 2, 0),

Due to her inability to speak during her infancy and later, we taught her sign language (ASL).  Over the years she dropped the sign language and gradually gained the ability to hear and speak , but what we referred to as her "language" no one was able to understand, it was more of a form of almost unintelligible English.  Not until later in our adolescence did I realize that no one could understand her as it became 2nd nature to us, we basically had to have a translator (family member) whenever she had interactions with other people in order for her to be understood.  The strange thing is, is that close family members never had any difficulty at all understanding what she was trying to communicate.  After many years of constant speech therapy, she was able to functionally communicate with people in their own language (English), but at home she would talk in her language.  Even now that she is no longer with us, when our family gets together we often have a conversation in the language that she taught us... strange but cool :)\nOz A.

The expected outcome was that the monkey would stay away from the mother because of the negative punishment response.  But this created the most dependent of monkeys, who clung even tighter to the mother.  So I guess in some cases I would disagree with the statement that punishment always turns into less of some action.   Another study I have heard of was also with monkeys.  There were some puzzles put in the monkeys cages.  But no positive thing had been put in there yet to encourage the monkeys to try out the puzzles.  Yet the monkeys played with the puzzles anyway and actually got surprisingly good at it.  Then they did a study where they compared monkey who had a reward for completing the task and a group where no reward was offered.  The ones without the incentive performed better at the experiment.\nWhen this study came out at the time it was very controversial to psychology and then later got dropped for a while.  But the overall idea is that there is a third drive besides reward and punishment.    It makes sense that animals and people would enjoy learning for the sake of learning because when we learn something new our brain rewards us with dopamine.  So there need be no outer reward.

It is characterized by an apparently confused usage of words with no apparent meaning or relationship attached to them. In this context, it is considered to be a symptom of a formal thought disorder. In some cases schizophasia can be a sign of asymptomatic schizophrenia; e.g. the question "Why do people believe in God?" could elicit a response consisting of a series of words commonly associated with religion or prayer but strung together with no regard to language rules.\nSchizophasia should be contrasted with another symptom of cognitive disruption and cognitive slippage involving certain idiosyncratic arrangements of words. With this symptom, the language may or may not be grammatically correct depending on the severity of the disease and the particular mechanisms which have been impacted by the disease.\nThe American diagnostic codes, from the DSM-IV, do not specifically code for this disorder although they include it as a symptom under the diagnosis of schizophrenia.  schizophasia word salad   ', 'users/139601830/puzzlesolver', '20 Nov ''13, 04:24', 173, 2, 0),

The plan was this: The team, led by Maria Gendron, would do a study similar to Ekmans original cross-cultural one, but without providing any of the special words or context-heavy stories that Ekman had used to guide his subjects answers. Barretts researchers would simply hand a jumbled pile of different expressions (happy, sad, fearful, angry, disgusted, and neutral) to their subjects, and would ask them to sort them into six piles. If emotional expressions are indeed universal, they reasoned, then the Himba would put all low-browed, tight-lipped expressions into an anger pile, all wrinkled-nose faces into a disgust pile, and so on.\nIt didnt happen that way. The Himba sorted some of the faces in ways that aligned with Ekmans theory: smiling faces went into one pile, wide-eyed fearful faces went into another, and affectless faces went mostly into a third. But in the other three piles, the Himba mixed up angry scowls, disgusted grimaces, and sad frowns. Without any suggestive context, of the kind that Ekman had originally provided, they simply didnt recognize the differences that leap out so naturally to Westerners."

But this doesn''t mean there is no factor. an example: phenylketonuria. It''s a genetic mutation. And people thought, when you have it, you''re mentally retarded. But it turns out that mental retardation doesn''t occur when a usual factor of the environment -phenylalanine in your food- is avoided.\nSecondly: the assumption of independence is false and leads to wrong conclusions: It''s not just possible that environment and genetics interact, they can also co-vary.\ninteraction: If an event is the result of the joint operation of a number of causative chains and if these causes interact in any generally accepted meaning of the word, it becomes conceptually impossible to assign quantitative values to the causes of that individual event. Only if the causes are utterly independent could we do so. For example if two men lay bricks to build a wall, we may quite fairly measure their contributions by counting the number laid by each; but if one mixes the mortar and the other lays the bricks, it would be absurd to measure their relative quantitative contributions by measuring the volumes of bricks and of mortar. It is obviously even more absurd to ascribe so many inches of a man''s height to his genes and so many to his environment.-richard lewontin 1974-.   covariation: the view people have on schizophrenia is that there is a genetic disposition and an environmental factor that triggers the disease. But there''s also something else: if you are poor it is more likely to express the genetic disposition. And if you have the genetic disposition it is also more likely you become poor. And by the way: correlation is not causation. With heridity you know how much of the variance is in accordance -correlates- with any given factor you want to choose and you attribute the rest of variance to other possible causes. But correlation is neither necessity-not everything is linearly linked- nor  sufficient-there does not need to be a causal link even though the correlation is very high. In short: heridity never takes interactions nor covariation with the environment into account.\nLyubomirsky et al. also didn''t seem to care as they published what determined happiness in 2005. They said: it''s a setpoint-50-, intentional activity-40- and circumstances-10-. Together that''s a 100 percent right, but what does it tell you. not anything about the causal link to genes.   We must begin to get beyond the ludicrous idea that our genes directly control our behaviors,our mental capacities and stated, or our aesthetic preferences, because they cannot; this idea is utter pseudo-scientific nonsense-D.S.Moore2001.The dependent gene-p.209-', 'users/100104209/marcus', '20 Jan ''14, 05:39', 121, 0, 1),

('100149981', 'Criminology- criminal behavior', 'null', 'During the history, a lot of theories were formulated about the criminal behaviour. Cesare Lombroso, one of the most famous pioneers of the criminology, came with the concept of atavism, the theory of the delinquent man. He said that criminals are distinguished from noncriminals by multiple physical anomalies. He postulated that criminals represented a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of man characterized by physical features reminiscent of apes, lower primates, and early man and to some extent preserved, he said, in modern "savages". The behavior of these biological "throwbacks" will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society. Through years of postmortem examinations and anthropometric studies of criminals, the insane, and normal individuals, Lombroso became convinced that the "born criminal" (reo nato, a term given by Ferri) could be anatomically identified by such items as a sloping forehead, ears of unusual size, asymmetry of the face, prognathism, excessive length of arms, asymmetry of the cranium, and other "physical stigmata". Specific criminals, such as thieves, rapists, and murderers, could be distinguished by specific characteristics, he believed. Lombroso also maintained that criminals had less sensibility to pain and touch; more acute sight; a lack of moral sense, including an absence of remorse; more vanity, impulsiveness, vindictiveness, and cruelty; and other manifestations, such as a special criminal argot and the excessive use of tattooing. Besides the "born criminal", Lombroso also described "criminaloids", or occasional criminals, criminals by passion, moral imbeciles, and criminal epileptics. He recognized the diminished role of organic factors in many habitual offenders and referred to the delicate balance between predisposing factors (organic, genetic) and precipitating factors such as one''s environment, opportunity, or poverty.

We could learn about as many things as we liked, free of cost, and get some kind of statement stating this. Being an active supporter of this, I advertised and promoted Udacity as if it were my own company. I encouraged as many people as possible to visit the site and take the courses. The other reason we all strongly connected with Udacity is because it doesn''t just focus on the develped nations but also the "third-world nation" where such quality education, even via internet, is hard to come by. I was even more impressed when Udacity implemented download links for people with slow internet connections in developing and undeveloped nations that couldn''t view the videos online. We all thought, "Here is a site that actually focuses on the whole world and not just the rich and famous." How very wrong we were! When we received the email about the phasing out of free certificates, we were first shocked, then devastated, then disgusted. However you word it, what you are essentially saying is "Screw free education, we''ve now gained publicity, we''ll stop the free stuff, which was our aim in establishing the website in the first place." It is not some but millions of people who cannot even imagine to afford to pay for your "verified certificates" - as you put it - that Udacity has let down. We feel cheated and let down. In my personal case, for instance, $150 a month means 15,000 in my local currency (NRs). For a student whose monthly expenditure including fooding and college tuition is less than half of that, I cannot even imagine paying for these certificates. It would take me a year to save the money for a months'' payment, and so is the case for millions of people in nations like mine. Yes, we know what you''ll say: "The courses are still available. It''s just the certifications that have been phased out.: But un-certified information was always available all over the web. Even University syllabus based lectures and videos are freely available all over the internet. Without the certificates (yes even free ones), there is no way of proving if we actually did the course. We all are seriously disappointed and deeply hurt by this action. We can only hope the people at the top level of Udacity are listening. Don''t do this! Don''t move away from why you were established in the first place!

Of course learning processes can lead you to activate the amygdala in totally different situations, especially when you want to maintain a hierarchy (evolution supported this too).

My heart rate is not the same all the time, of course, but heart rate is an objective measure because all measurements of it taken at one point in time should be the same regardless of who (or what machine) takes the measurement. So if I get hooked up to three different machines and two nurses also take my pulse at the same time, all 5 measurements of my heart rate should be about the same (maybe 60, 61, 59, 60, 61 - we expect some small error is possible). If one machine reads 80 while the others all read 60 we assume the machine which read 80 is broken. We don''t assume that 80 is a valid opinion of my heart rate because heart rate is not subjective. It is not subject to different opinions. \nA subjective measurement would be expected to vary with the observer and or with the observation. Movie rating is subjective because different people have different opinions on the same movie and each of these is equally valid. Some of this subjectivity could be because the measurement scale is subject to interpretation. If I ask people to rate a movie on a scale 1 to 5 then there might be very different meanings implied by different people when they use the rating 2. This can be clarified by assigning meanings to the scale levels like: 1 = hated this movie, 2 = didn''t like, 3 = ok, 4 = liked, 5 = loved. This, at least, ensures that two people who each rated a movie 4 both liked, but did not love the movie. The movie rating is still subjective because I might like different movies than you. But at least we can remove the subjectivity related to a fuzzy scale.\nAsking someone to recall how many hours of homework they did last week is subjective because they may not recall properly or may be moved to overestimate out of guilt for not doing as much homework as they had wished, etc. However it seems to me if you have them log their homework hours each day you are moving closer to an objective measure, assuming you don''t think they will lie. If someone observes them and records their homework hours this would certainly be objective (assuming you can tell, by looking at them, if they are doing homework). \nSo, it seems to me that it is not the case that every self-reported measurement is subjective (or at least not equally subjective). If I record my pulse every day when I wake up that is an objective measurement. If I am asked to recall what I think my pulse might have been on prior days when I did not measure, that is subjective. Both of these might be considered self-reported. The question is whether a measurement or recording was made vs whether a person is recalling.', '06 Jun ''13, 17:08', 12),

('100065297', '100064953', 'users/100067936/melissa-rice', 'Further thoughts:\nScientific measurements of physical quantities are generally able to be done in an objective fashion. This is because the things being measured are matters of fact, not opinion. I don''t expect two different observers to each have a valid (but differing) opinion on my height. When we measure in this way there are two ways to evaluate the quality of the measurement: precision and accuracy.  \nPrecision means how finely can we measure (usually depends on the resolution of the measuring instrument). For instance: if I am measuring height to the nearest cm then a measuring stick marked off in cm increments will do and I can measure a person''s height as 180cm. If I need more precision in this measurement then I need a measuring stick marked off in mm in which case I can measure 180.3cm. Better precision.\nAccuracy means how close is the measurement to the true height. If a person is really 180.0cm high and I measure 185.354cm, this is very precise but not very accurate. Why? Perhaps my ruler is not correctly marked. Perhaps I am too short to see the ruler properly. Perhaps the ruler wasn''t vertical. Perhaps I need glasses to read the ruler properly, etc. Regardless of how precisely the ruler is marked the accuracy will not be good if I don''t use the ruler properly.\nRepeatability is also important - the degree to which you can get the same value (within the expected accuracy and precision range) from multiple measurements. If you make the measurement 10 times, what range of values do you get? Usually there''s some kind of normal distribution of the measurements and we assume (barring systemic error) that the average reading is an estimator of the true value. Repeatability does not guarantee accuracy (if the instrument is broken or the observer is not properly trained they could make a bad measurement which is bad in some repeatable way, like reading the scale wrong or the instrument maxing out). \nSome quantities are inherently subjective because they are matters of opinion, not fact. How attractive is that person? How did you like that movie, or music, or art work? These are matters of opinion. They do not have an underlying fact that we are measuring so there is no hope of anything but a subjective measurement. Seems like we mostly are not talking about these sorts of things at present.\nOther quantities are inherently objective but difficult to measure objectively. How much time did you spend on homework last week? Say you spent 12 hours. This is a fact. If we can agree on a measurable definition of what constitutes doing homework we could theoretically measure this. But we have to work hard to measure this accurately. Someone needs to watch you and be able to determine when you are doing homework and when not (pretty objective). Or you log it yourself and we hope you are truthful and log carefully (somewhat less objective). If we ask you to recall how much time you spent on homework last week, this is a much more subjective measurement, but the quantity being measured is still inherently objective (there is a certain number of hours you did actually spent on homework last week and we would know it if we had set up the proper measurement apparatus). If we want to improve the measurement we think about what can go wrong: you don''t recall properly, you lie, you have a different idea of what counts as "doing homework" than what the experimenter means, etc. Then we try to make a measurement system that addresses each problem we are concerned about.\nI would say your example (witness testimony about a crime scene) falls into this last category. There was a murderer at the crime scene and there were witnesses. These are indisputable facts. If we had cameras and DNA testing on the scene during the crime we could very objectively determine the murderer, I would think. Unless the murderer has a twin, perhaps.\nMost likely (if we are arguing about it) the witness is making a subjective measurement in fingering the defendant, but there are different degrees of subjectivity.\nIf I am standing right next to the murderer and see him commit the murder and he is very well known to me, then my "measurement" is pretty objective. Unless I''m lying for some reason. After all, do you think you would have any difficulty identifying your family or close friends in good lighting at close range? No. So this is very strongly repeatable, which makes it more like an objective measurement. But only for truthful, trained observers under ideal conditions (which means, in this case, people who also know the defendant very well, at close-range in good viewing conditions). \nIf it is dark and I don''t know the murderer and I am 2 blocks away, well, that seems rather weak. This would be a much more subjective "measurement" because it''s not likely to be very repeatable. It may be helpful to think about what would compromise accuracy and precision of such a measurement.\nThis illustrates how complex experimental design can be. The security folks have a useful idea called a "threat model". If you want to make something secure you have to decide what sort of threat you are defending against (that''s the threat model). Likewise, if you want to design a good experiment you have to envision what can go wrong and how to design the experiment to minimize that particular problem. So I think the examples given for subjective vs. objective are part of this process of understanding what sorts of problems can render experimental data less useful and then looking at how to design the experiment to reduce or avoid these problems. These experimental design principles arose out of earlier experiments that actually encountered these sorts of problems so the experimenters said, "hey, we can do it better next time if we....".\nSo it seems to me we''ve mostly been looking at things which have an objective underlying value and asking what can get in the way of measuring that value (lying, poor recall, suggestibility, bad measurement, etc) and then asking how we can design the experiment to minimize that problem. \nBut also bear in mind I am not trained in experimental design so I''m just speaking from tangential experience in science/math research. \nWhat do you think? Can a witness every be fully objective in identifying a criminal? Can we ever know if the witness is objective? For instance, can we ever know for sure if the witness may be lying? This seems to happen often enough (the witness is lying to protect his/her self or others or because threatened by the police, etc). I think objective/subjective measurement is a continuum and it''s just very complex to place any particular measurement on the continuum.', '06 Jun ''13, 19:27', 3),

Those are actually two separate groups of people.  When it says that the people are the "same," it means that they come from the same sample, and that the attributes of the two groups are relatively the same.  And when the question says that they are different, it is referring to the differences in the dependent variable.  Remember that we manipulate the independent variable and we measure the dependent variable.\nLet me give you an example of a hypothetical experiment.  Say we wanted to figure out if caffeine caused college students to sleep less over the course of a day. First we would gather a bunch of college students and ask them how much they sleep per day (lets say that the average of sleep the college students reported was 8 hours per day).  Next, we would randomly assign them to one of two groups, the control group and the experimental group.  \n***Here are are the variables:\nIndependent variable- Caffeine\nDependent variable- Sleep\nMore importantly, here is a breakdown of the groups and their characteristics so far:\nControl Group- College students that sleep an average of 8 hours per day.\nExperimental Group- College students that sleep an average of 8 hours per day.\n***As you can see, before we actually run the experiment, the groups are the same.\nNow lets run the experiment.\nNext we would give one group no caffeine (the control group), and we would give the other group caffeine (the experimental group).  After a day passed we would find out how much time people in each group slept.  After we asked both groups how much they slept, we find out that on average the control group (the group that did not receive caffeine) still slept 8 hours that day, and the experimental group (the group that received caffeine) on average reported sleeping only 6 hours that day.\nNow lets take a look at the groups after we ran the experiment and the independent variable (caffeine) was manipulated:\nControl Group- College students that slept an average of 8 hours \nExperimental Group- College students that slept an average of 6 hours \n***As you can see, now the groups are different, and the only thing that happened different between the groups was whether or not they received caffeine.  \nSo now, since the only thing that happened different between the groups was was whether or not they received caffeine, we can say that the difference between the groups was caused by the independent variable (caffeine).\nI really hope this helped because I know that part of the material can be confusing.

Below is an abstract of a real research article that indicates there are some differences between gender and how they react to caffeine.  Just though it might be interesting.\nCaffeine increases blood pressure (BP). In men, acute BP elevations after caffeine intake are due to an increase in vascular resistance, with no change in cardiac output. The hemodynamic effects of caffeine have not been studied in women. Accordingly, BP and hemodynamic responses to caffeine were measured in a double-blind trial comparing age-matched men and women at rest and during mental stress. Caffeine (3.3 mg/kg, equivalent to 2 to 3 cups of brewed coffee) or placebo was given to separate groups of women (n = 21 and 21) and men (n = 16 and 19) (mean ages 29 and 27 years, respectively). BP, cardiac output, and vascular resistance were observed at rest, during a stressful public-speaking simulation, reading aloud, and recovery. Caffeine caused nearly identical systolic and diastolic BP elevations in women (4.5 and 3.3 mm Hg, respectively) and men (4.1 and 3.8 mm Hg, respectively). Men given caffeine versus placebo showed the expected elevation in vascular resistance throughout the remainder of the protocol (p &lt;0.001), with no difference in cardiac output. In contrast, women responded to caffeine with increases in stroke volume (p &lt;0.001) and cardiac output (p &lt;0.001), with no difference in vascular resistance from women taking placebo. Men and women have similar BP responses to caffeine, but the BP responses may arise from different hemodynamic mechanisms. Women who consume a dietary dose of caffeine showed an increase in cardiac output, whereas men showed increased vascular resistance.\nHartley, T.R., Lovallo, W.R., &amp; Whitsett, T.L..  (2004).

The study discussed is of a common sort one sees reported in magazines and newspapers, making a claim that high fives cause happiness, and pointing out that it was a randomized study done with a control group and an independent and dependent variables. Not blind in this case, but such studies, not being correlational observation studies, are often referred to as "gold standard" in research and much made of the results. However, we also know that results reported even under these conditions are often wrong. For example, Ioannidis famously showed that more than half of research results published in peer reviewed journals are false (see "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False"), with results much more likely to be false for things like pharmaceutical studies where the organization sponsoring the study stands to benefit financially from a particular result.\nA question one may wish to consider is whether smiles in a work environment are equivalent to measuring happiness. Another would be to define what one means by happiness. Is it the number of smiles or something else. Consider for example a sexually hostile work environment where an authority figure with power, such as a boss, or even a very respected colleague who would never be fired, starts slapping coworkers not on the hand, but on the ass, and it is known that those who complain about this are seen as troublemakers and fired. This situation at work was very common in the US until the 1990s when fear of sexual harassment lawsuits caused some reform. But it still exists in the work environment in many cultures. Does a smile from a coworker after receiving their ass-slap indicate they are truly happy, for however we have defined happiness in the study? Or perhaps it instead indicates seething resentment. Perhaps the smiling coworker is actually as a result of the slap contemplating either suicide or strangling their coworker/boss one night when no one else is there. To assume that smiles equate or even correlate with happiness, whatever happiness is, would have to be demonstrated in a proper study and quantified. Unfortunately finding flaws such as these, where conclusions are based on untested and unsubstantiated assumptions, is quite common in research studies. Or fortunately, because it is exceptionally valuable to be able to identify such flaws which are endemic, and realize that the vast majority of claimed scientific results that are constantly trotted out to support some political or financial agenda are absolute bunk.\nOf course it will be said this is an intro course and things can not be covered in depth, but intro courses are the most common exposure college students have to many fields.

But if the person themselves writes it down it''s called "subjective". This is not really a traditional definition of the word. It''s more of an attempt to paint that which is written down by a credentialled academic as "the truth", but that which a layman writes down, as "subjective and unreliable", even when it is exactly the same information. It''s basically an attempt to use language to paint one group''s opinions, measurements and judgments as more reliable.\nIt''s very similar to the way that the histories of non-white peoples are considered unreliable, unverified and false, but a history written down by a white person, like Julius Caesar''s Gallic Wars, is considered to be a true and accepted history, evidence of proof that things claimed in the history were real and happened. Even though the only  difference is whether the person reporting is white (an "objective" report according to western academics) or non-white (a subjective mythology, considered untrue according to western academics.)\nConsider the current practice of psychological diagnosis. People are often evaluated according to a diagnostic checklist to determine if they are "depressed". Then a treatment is prescribed, which doesn''t differ from the treatment of many other "disorders". If the person merely says they are depressed or are not depressed, that is considered unreliable and subjective, but an outside observer with a checklist, which has never really been validated, is considered objective. If a non-licensed practitioner gives the checklist though it is not considered a valid diagnosis. The only criteria for objective in much of the field is not whether it is objective according to traditional definitions, but whether the authority making the pronouncement is part of the existing power structure.\nWe might also ask, if we are to consider a person''s self logging of their own experiences to be subjective, what should be said of a researcher''s logging of his own experimental data, particularly should professional or financial advantage be likely to follow from getting certain results. Would it not be better to use a third party observer, one who does not benefit from the results of the study, to be the one to log all the data.

Eye pigmentation is the result of the pigment, melanin, deposited by special pigmentation cells called melanocytes. Because humans originated in Africa, where the suns rays are the harshest, melanocytes produced lots of melanin (pigment) to make dark skin which protects the body''s cells from DNA-damaging UV radiation. These same cells with lots of melanin make brown eyes. As humans moved out of Africa to climates with less sunlight, there was selection for less melanin so that enough of the suns rays could get in the skin to help make vitamin D (one of the good effects of the sun for you!). Eyes began to lighten as skin lightened, but currently there''s no evidence to suggest that there was any natural selection pressure for differently colored eyes; just differently colored skin that also affected the eyes. However, sexual selection has been shown to favor lightly colored eyes. In other words, as lighter eyes appeared, humans tended to prefer the lighter colors like amber, green, and blue.\nThat said, there are reports that having differently colored eyes can result in different abilities, though the research is still ongoing. Lighter colored eyes (blue) are at more risk of macular degeneration.

Alas, scientists are also human and may be subject to the same failings as other humans, despite their scientific training. \nFinally, I think there are some grave problems with the way we fund and conduct research and disseminate this information and it would be very interesting to have a longer conversation about how to fix this. Perhaps in another thread?\nI would also like to argue that good experimental design, data collection, and analysis are absolutely crucial to ending up with useful scientific conclusions and these issues can be subtle and are not always reducible to something like politics, paternalism, or authoritarianism although they may often be intermixed with these. \nI think a good starting point is to look at the etymology of these terms. Objective refers to a property of the object, say, the length of a movie, and hence should be measured the same by all observers. The movie is 2 hours long regardless of who watches it. \nSubjective refers to a property of the subject, say the rating of a movie, which is a property of the observer (the subject) not a property of the movie (the object). Different people can be expected to give different ratings of the same movie. Perception of movie length is also subjective because we are asking how long the subject felt the movie to be (a property of the subject) not how long the movie actually was (a property of the object). \nBoth objective and subjective questions may be useful and interesting to ask. In both cases we hope to answer the questions as accurately as possible, but the experimental design, data collection, and ways to acheive accuracy may be different.\nAn objective question about movie length might be: Has the average length of movies increased since 1975? To achieve an accurate answer we would need to establish a method of getting a representative sampling of movies for each year and then compute the average length of the movies in each year since 1975. An intuitive way to answer the question would be to graph this data as a time series and observe the trend. The more objective way to answer the question is to use statistical methods to estimate the probability that such a trend could result from random data. \nSo the objective/subjective issue appears in several ways here. First, the data itself represents an objective measurement (movie length). Second, the way we analyze the data can be subjective or objective. If the trend in movie length over time is not strong then different people can look at the graph and some may see an increasing trend and some may not. For this reason, using inferential statistics is more objective because once we all agree on the specific method and the level of confidence then everyone should get the same answer from the same data. And the answer would look something like this perhaps: there is a 99% chance that movies have increased in average length since 1975 (or another way to say it is that there is only a 1% chance that movie length is not increasing but we just happened to get a non-representative sample). In this paradigm we increase accuracy by increasing sample size so that we can increase confidence level and by using techniques for acheiving representative samples.\nIn contrast we can ask an inherently subjective question about the same data (movie length) by asking "Do you think that average movie length has increased since 1975?" This is a perfectly valid question but we are asking about peoples'' perception of movie length, not about the actual length of the movies. So it is subjective (and subjective is not meant as a value judgement). We know that perception of the passage of time is not particularly accurate in humans but depends on mental state (when we are bored time appears to pass more slowly than when we are interested or excited). And because it is a subjective question the experiment is trying to answer then it is entirely appropriate to ask people a subjective question about their perception (rather than measuring actual length).\nSo both of these questions about movie length are valid and interesting but the experimental designs are not interchangeable. We can''t get a good estimate of actual movie length by asking people how long the movie seemed to be (the boring movies may have length overestimated and the exciting movies may have length underestimated). So how do we know if movies are getting longer over time or just more boring? This would be a poorly designed study because we can''t have confidence that it answers the question we posed about actual movie length. \nIn the same way, the second question (about perceived movie length) cannot be answered with objective data about actual movie length. It is an inherently subjective question and needs a subjective question to be asked as a part of the experimental design.\nSo it''s not that objective data is always better than subjective data. But they are different and require different experimental designs. In each case we should be clear and precise about what we want to know, and design the experiment to find that out as accurately as we can.\nIn the example of asking about homework time, if we want to know about students'' perception of how much time they are spending on homework then we should ask them (this is inherently a subjective question so we collect subjective data to answer it). \nIf we want to know about actual time spent on homework (an objective question) then it will be more accurate to have students log their time each day than to guess at the end of the week. This is not insulting the students, just using common sense to improve the quality of the data collected. \nThere may be situations where logging is not going to be accurate enough. Suppose you are studying a population of high-school students who are under court order to spend 10 hours a week doing homework in order to avoid being sent to juvenile detention and you want to know if this is effective at improving grades. Having the students log their own hours is not likely to be a good experimental design in this case. A better design might be an after-school program where attendence is taken and study help offered. \nThis could be interpreted as a judgement against the students (these students are bad people and they will lie) or it could be viewed as a recognition that experimental variables need to be controlled to get good data. For instance, possibly these students are from difficult living situations where they may not have the skills or opportunity to study effectively at home (not their fault, perhaps, but an aspect of their reality which effects whether they study and how effectively). Also, it is human nature to lie to avoid punishment, especially punishment which is perceived as undeserved. So whether we want to label such lying as "bad" is really not relevant to the experiment. But if the logging of homework time is not accurate then the data collected will be garbage and the study will be worthless (or worse, misleading). From such a poorly-designed study we might erroneously conclude that these students are not intelligent because even if you force them to study 10 hours a week their grades still do not improve. Perhaps what was really happening is that they didn''t actually study because their home-life did not permit it or because they don''t have good study skills and aren''t able to study effectively even if they put in the seat-time. \nSo good experimental design is critical and you can''t get a good experimental design by ignoring the reality of the population you study. Unfortunately, just about any legitimate experimental design technique or scientific model can be twisted and used to evil purposes, just as perfectly fine fountain pens can be used to sign treaties we don''t intend to keep. It doesn''t mean we should stop using fountain pens or scientific method or good experimental design technique.\nTo some extent, the peer-reviewed research system provides a partial remedy for such evil uses of science by putting out detailed information about the experiment so that right-minded persons can point out the flaws in design, data collection, and analysis. Sadly, societies can hold their prejudices deeply so even this sensible system is not a cure-all. After all, the U.S. Declaration of Independence says "all men are created equal" and it has taken us over 200 years (and still counting) to fully understand what the word "all" means in this context, despite the fact that the same sentence of the same document asserts that this fact is supposed to be self-evident.', '17 Jun ''13, 21:31', 1);

The technique of doing so was developed by Clarence Little. Little was an interesting guy, he was also notorious for advocating the forced sterilization and/or euthanization of non-white, poor and otherwise disadvantaged people, and others he felt were undesirable. (His advocacy and testimony resulted in states passing legislation resulting in the widespread involuntary sterilization of african americans and american indians.)  He was also famous for his militant advocacy of claims and "scientific" testimony that smoking cigarettes absolutely does not cause cancer, testimony for which the tobacco industry paid him and made him rich.\nBack to those mice, so if you inbreed mice with their siblings for 20 generations, you generate mice that are so genetically similar that you can continue to breed them and get essentially identical mice with no variations due to mother-father differences. They don''t actually have identical DNA though, just similar enough to produce this effect. In particular, they will be homozygous at all loci, which means they have identical alleles from mother and father at each loci, so there''s no variation in the genes they pass to their offspring. Pair them with another with the same configuration and you can systematically reproduce offspring. You could do the same with humans, if you were as insanely an unethical and corrupt researcher as the person who devised the technique. You''d also need more than one lifetime to do this, so you''d have to set up a multigenerational lab to do the experiment with your dungeon or wherever one is keeping the human subjects, who would probably not be happy with the experiment.\nIt''s not the sort of thing you''re likely to randomly find in nature though. Since every culture has incest taboos, you wouldn''t see something like this going on systematically for 20 generations lacking an external agent to force it to happen.', '18 Jun ''13, 00:45', 10),

Also, for example, children in primary (elementary) school are capable of ''simple'' formal operations through guided science experiments in class. They are also able to ''idealise'' and so on.

She was not shy at all, but the determining factors for her considering herself an introvert were that she preferred her own company and doing solitary activities, and that although she enjoyed being around people - always needed some time alone afterwards to find balance and recharge.  I, on the other hand, always get more energy from being around people, than I do alone, and if by my self too long, find my energy depletes.  However, that does not mean I like crowds - in fact I only like crowds if I''m standing in front of them, or well back away from them.', '20 Jun ''13, 11:32', 0),

Note the fMRI findings and the fascinating finding that painkillers like Tylenol actually relieve EMOTIONAL pain too!: \n"Being rejected hurts. In fact, social exclusion creates physical pain. In one study on the neural\nbasis for social pain, participants were brought into a lab with an fMRI scanner and were told they\nwould be involved in an electronic ball tossing game called Cyberball (Eisenberger et al., 2003;\nMasten et al., 2009). Once inside the scanner, they could see, on a screen, a Cyberball game that\nwas apparently in progress between two other research participants in scanners in diff erent rooms.\nUnknown to the participant, there were no other people playing the game. After watching the others\nplay for a few throws, the participant joined in. For a while, the three players continued playing\nCyberball together. After seven throws, the other players stopped throwing the ball to the participant\nand resumed their game. In eff ect, the participant was left out, as Thalia had been. Participants\nreported being upset about their exclusion. Whats more, the fMRI scans showed activation of brain\ncircuitry involved in physical pain, especially those areas that are involved with how unpleasant pain\nfeels. Indeed, this kind of social pain can be relieved by painkillers like Tylenol (DeWall et al., 2010)\nand may aff ect endocrine systems that support social connection (Maner et al., 2010). Also, people\nwho are more sensitive to physical pain are more sensitive to the pain of rejection, and these diff erences\nmay have a genetic basis (Eisenberger et al., 2006; Way, Taylor, &amp; Eisenberger, 2009)." \n    Feist &amp; Rosenberg, 2012, p. 548. \nCheck out some of the references if you have access to them.

I would be in a regular rather flat dream; low color not a clear story, when as if someone had changed a channel I would be in a white room with a dear friend of mine, Howie. Backstory; I fell despartly in love with Howie on the first day of Jr High, we became friends , much to my disappointment, just friends. Howie always said if we were to date it would ruin our friendship. A very sweet way of saying "I am not into you" . I still was mad for him through high school though we remained "just friends". I saw him years later after college. We went out once at laughed at how silly that was - Friendship was definatly they way to go. At 21 Howie died in a car accident. I could not bring myself to go to the funeral- He was not dead to me. Fast forward 10 years, I ''m married have 2 children and life is a bit tough, not going as I hoped. I start having "Howie dreams" , middle of a dream the channel would  change and I would be in a white room with Howie who is wearing a Hawaiian shirt ( he always wore one in high school). I would talk to him about present day issues I was having and though I don''t recall him ever telling me exact advice, I always felt a burden had been lifted and I was enlightened. I would wake up in the morning very happy and plan to call him. Then within moments, seconds I would remember he was not ...reachable. The more trials my life brought, the more "Howie Dreams" I would have always with the same result in the morning - But even after the realization I still found great comfort. Years passed, my guess, 10 or so. My personal life was still pitchy but I was stronger. One night to my delight the channel changed in my dream, only this time Howie was at an outdoor cafe on a corner , very European looking or maybe San Francisco. He still looked 21 , as he always had, but I became aware if me and what age I was. I was now close to 40. Howie reached out a took my hand and I felt it. We sat at the table in front of the cafe the morning air was crisp and the sunrise was beautiful. The sprinklers were on and a rainbow shone through and the mist was cold on face. I asked Howie why we were here. He replied because it was the last time I was going to see him. He said I didn''t need him to be strong - He hugged me and kissed me (on the cheek) which I felt , and can still remember to this day . I awoke that morning sobbing out of control. My then husband asked what was wrong - I said Howie died. He was very confused, because he knew Howie had died years ago. My day was spent crying and morning.

And then I started seriously studying and having lucid dreams when I was 15 years old. I am already 16 years old now, but I am still having lucid dreams until now. When I don''t have lucid dreams, I experience extremely vivid dreams. \n\nThis takes a lot of practice to be able to do. I want to know if any\nof you have ever been able to lucid dream and if so what was it like\nand how did you teach yourself to lucid dream?\n\nWhen I''m in a lucid dream, I start to realize how life-like dreams really are. For example, I can feel my surroundings, emotionally (atmosphere of the place) and physically (touching the objects, etc.). In dreams, just to cite a few more examples, I can also taste the food, listen to music, and sing. \nFunny, often times, the food, music and even the songs are completely new to me, but surprisingly, the food actually tastes VERY well. The music sounds incredibly good, too - while the singing, I''m honestly not sure I could come up with something like that in real life, because like the food and music, it''s very unique but also suprisingly good. \nThere was a time I dreamt I was in this opera. The song was very pleasant to the ear, and when I woke from that dream, the first thing I remember doing was singing the last few notes I could remember, but a couple of seconds later, it faded away. I can''t remember any of the song (but only some vague memory of some scenes from the play); it''s sad, because if I could remember even just that, I would have come up with an amazing song to share with my friend; it was really just that good.\nI could also socialize with the dream characters there (like engage in a bit of small talk, for example. Sometimes, when I have a phone with me in my dream, I can even send and receive texts, just like in real life).\nBasically, what I realized from all my lucid dreaming experiences is that, what I can do in real life, I can also do in my dreams.\nFurther, I could also even do things I cannot in real life, like play instruments (that I don''t even know how to play in real life) , drive cars, fly, shift the environment into something else, summon dream characters and objects, and so much more. \nLast night, I dreamt that I was chatting with my friend. Really, I could use a computer in my dream, just like I am doing right now in real life: I can feel myself tapping the keyboard, I can even see and remember the chat dialogues we make (before I started lucid dreaming, I could barely even remember myself being able to read anything in dreams because the text usually jumble or fade away as I''m reading it), and often times, the website I''m chatting in my dreams are the same in real life (in one of my dreams, I was chatting on Facebook, and I saw the same design there w/ the same friends on my newsfeed, etc.) and they''re just as interactive as well, like if I would scroll down, posts would automatically be generated in my newsfeed, just like they would in real life.\nI taught myself how to lucid dream by reading different books on the topic, as well joining in different forums.\n\nI have been aware of the fact that I was dreaming but I have never\nbeen able to actually change the outcome of a dream. Usually once I\nrealize it is a dream I just wake up. What about you?\n\nThe first time I had a successful lucid dream, I remember it was because I listened to some binaural beats. This binaural beats helped stabilized my lucid dream, in a way that once I realized that I was dreaming, I would remain very calm (so I wouldn''t be too excited &amp; eventually wake up from that) and focused on my purpose to experience lucid dream.\nI would recommend listening to it as well before sleeping.

Co-habitation seems like it''s more popular than ever and who knows, maybe it''s because younger folks choose that based on witnessing their parents divorce or someone they know divorcing and all of the negative consequences that went along with that process.\nI believe children are the most wonderful thing that a union can produce and you don''t need to be married to produce, provide for or love them.  I believe the nature part of nature vs. nurture never stops and so the person you are, or the person you think you want to marry at 30 will be a different person at 40, 50, 60 - a continuous process of evolution that may - or may not - progress along increasingly divergent paths until you perhaps realize the certainty of your eternal love at 30 was more hope than reality and now what are you going to do?\nI''m all for love since I believe life would be unimaginably empty and lonely without it, but I cannot say the same for marriage.', '24 Jun ''13, 21:24', 1),

Regarding REM sleep, you also get that every night. You see, our sleep goes through 5 stages. Yes, it''s mandatory. Not just one 1 stage, but 5 whole stages. One of those stages is REM sleep. \nJust to give you an idea of what REM sleep is, it is the stage which is the longest lasting &amp; the one that gives us the most vivid and most memorable dreams. Also, REM sleep helps restore our body, and  it also influences memory. \nNow that you know that REM is a part of vital stages of sleep, it''s highly unlikely that you go to sleep every night, but don''t get REM sleep.\nThat being said, the problem here maybe because you are just not very good at recalling your dreams. It could be also possible that you''re not having enough REM sleep, which you can solve by adjusting to a healthier sleeping lifestyle. I recommend visiting SleepWarrior.com for articles to help you develop a better sleep lifestyle + reading their free ebook on the 40 sleep hacks. Really helpful stuff.\nThe good news about dream recall is that, much like any other skill, can be practiced and developed overtime. :)  (Here''s my tip: Try practicing it by keeping a dream journal. Basically, what you do is that, the moment you wake up, you pick up your dream journal and you list down keywords for the things/scenes you remember from your dream. I would recommend min. of 5 keywords. Again, just keywords - doesn''t have to be long, extremely detailed descriptions of your entire dream. :D\nThis tricks the brain into thinking that it''s VITAL to remember those dreams, and consequently, the next time you dream, your brain will try harder to remember more details about your dreams, thus improving your dream recall.

Some people may deal with the stages in different orders or may not deal with some of the stages at all but I do think it is safe to say that everyone goes through at least a few of the typical stages.\nThe 5 stages are:\ndenial and isolation - The first reaction to learning of terminal illness or death of a cherished loved one is to deny the reality of the situation. This is also the first stage of pain that people go through.\nanger - As the masking effects of denial and isolation begin to wear, reality and its pain re-emerge. We are not ready. The intense emotion is deflected from our vulnerable core, redirected and expressed instead as anger. \nbargaining - The normal reaction to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability is often a need to regain control\ndepression - Two types of depression are associated with mourning. The first one is a reaction to practical implications relating to the loss.  This phase may be eased by simple clarification and reassurance. The second type of depression is more subtle and, in a sense, perhaps more private. It is our quiet preparation to separate and to bid our loved one farewell. Sometimes all we really need is a hug.\nacceptance - Reaching this stage of mourning is a gift not afforded to everyone. Death may be sudden and unexpected or we may never see beyond our anger or denial. It is not necessarily a mark of bravery to resist the inevitable and to deny ourselves the opportunity to make our peace. \nI have been lucky to not experience death many times, the only person close to me who has died was my grandma a few years ago. When she died I definitely went through the first stage of denial and isolation. I kept to myself and didn''t really want to be around anyone. I hid my emotions and didn''t want to show how upset I was. I pushed away the people closest to me. I eventually went through the second stage of anger where I came to the realization of why I was acting that way and was able to see that it was the passing of my grandma that was causing all of my emotions. I do not think I went through much depression, but I did go through some of the bargaining stage. I think everyone goes through a what if stage, and I know I definitely did.  Eventually I came to the acceptance stage, but to this day I still regret being in such a rush at one of my graduation events that I couldnt take a quick picture with her. She died a month later and I still wish I would have just stopped for a second and taken that picture.', '25 Jun ''13, 18:46', 1),

But you further state a rate of divorce in this country of between 40 - 50%!  By definition that would suggest that half of married people are sad and suffer from extremely poor mental and physical health!  I would submit that if marriage were a drug trial it would be prematurely halted because of the adverse effects it was having on an unacceptably high percentage of the test subjects!\nI agree that where children are concerned, a happy union of both parents is incredibly beneficial.

This occurs not only with hallucinogenic drugs, it can also occur with drugs we may think are rather benign, such as aspirin. This is why the Human Subjects Review Boards carefully consider the potential risks vs the potential benefits of the research. In this case, the boards thought that the benefits from psilocybin outweighed the risks. However, it is very important to remember that the researchers had to develop inclusion and exclusion criteria to get approval. That is, they had to identify people who should be included and those who should not included, based on a variety of variables (e.g., previous addiction problems, mental health difficulties, etc.). This helps to ensure that people susceptible of having a negative experience are not included in the study. Another thing to consider once the person has met the inclusion criteria for the study,  is that the participant has been informed of the potential risks and potential benefits and he or she provides informed consent to participate. Finally, why would the person participate if there might be negative consequences? In the cases presented in this lesson, the participants were experiencing much psychological distress and, therefore, they were willing to participate because they felt, personally, they might have a greater chance of experiencing a benefit. I hope this answers your question! \nThanks!\nDr. Snycerski', '26 Jun ''13, 22:01', 1),

('100080672', '100077423', 'users/119901270/benjamin-159', 'I have quite a bit of experience with Lucid Dreaming and I might be able to help! There are a few things that you can do in daily life that will really help you conquer this issue. It can take some time to learn (1-3 months average), however, considering the severity of the dreams it sounds like you are having, it might be worth the wait. First off, keep a dream journal. Whenever you wake up take that dream journal and write in it as many details from your dreams as you can, however minute they may be. It is imperative you do this right after you wake up because dreams are forgotten very fast and seem to deteriorate with movement. After about a week or two you should start to notice patterns when you dream. It might be something like a relative whom you rarely see, or a boss from an old job, or an ex girlfriend/boyfriend. You must condition yourself to question reality whenever you see one of these triggers. \nSo now we move onto reality checks. During your day there are a few subtle things that I recommend you do frequently. One of them is to look at your hand and count your fingers. If you are having trouble counting or notice a tentacle arm (or other odd feature about your hand) you will know you are dreaming. Another check is to hold your nose and see if you can still breathe. I usually do this under the guise of adjusting my glasses. Another check is to simply look at your watch, remember the time then about 10 seconds later look back and see if it has changed drastically. If it has, you are dreaming. Finally, there is looking in a mirror. If you look in a mirror and see a disfigured or younger version of yourself, you are dreaming. \nYou will want to perform one of these reality checks at least once an hour (once every 15 minutes if you want to be really thorough) in waking life. It is important to note that you should do this whilst you are using you dream journal, not after. Also, don''t time your reality checks down to the hour, as time is not reliable in a dream. You will just end up confusing yourself in a dream.  \nNow that we are done with the lengthy preparations, let''s get to what to actually do once you realize you are dreaming. Once you realize you are dreaming, which for me happened about a week into trying, there is one of two things you can do. In your case, you probably just want to get out of the dream. Good news! Usually once you realize you are dreaming you will get very excited and wake up. But, if you want the added perks of unlimited control and power in an alternate reality then you may continue. \nIf you want to have fun in your dream you can stabilize it once you realize you are lucid. To do this, either rub your hands together (like you do when they are cold), which will bring a vibrancy of color and will seem to turn the saturation up on the dream. You should also be very tactile. Touch as much as possible during the first (seeming) 5 minutes. You can spin around if you want to go somewhere else, this would be useful if you are in a scary place. \nNow that you have stabilized the dream, I will tell you about control. Dreams are limitless. If you can think it, you can do it. With NO ill affects in the real world. If you die in a dream there will be absolutely no harm to you in the real world. So don''t be afraid to try cool stuff. You also typically cannot feel pain in dreams unless you want to. So feel free to cause all the debauchery you want. \nAs I said dreams are limitless. You can go wherever and do whatever. If you want to go on a date with your favorite actor/actress you can and the outcome will be whatever you will it to be. Just note that getting too excited in a dream can cause you to wake up if it is not stable enough. \nFinally I leave you with this, you can discover things about yourself that you never knew in dreams. The professors might disagree here because this is not tested, but I believe the following to be true. All the characters in your dreams are manifestations of your subconsciousness. If you ask them a question they will answer honestly. \nGood luck with your Lucid Dreaming!', '30 Jun ''13, 00:24', 1),

If it''s two days, the person might not need a different amount than they took before. However, someone who has been taking a drug for years on a regular basis will probably be taking a bigger amount than they did initially because their body adjusted to that drug being there for so long. People who have been using a drug regularly for years who try to quit abusing it immediately will also go through withdrawal and have issues since their body is used to the drug''s presence and may be producing less or more of a chemical in response to the drug''s effects. It might depend on the kind of drug too, since some are harder than others.\nLet me try a concrete example. If a person goes off a stimulant, then they might withdraw and show signs of depression as their body is producing less dopamine than when the drug helped stimulate that production.\nDoes that make sense?

The body simply cannot stay awake indefinitely, and it will shut down when it reaches that point.

He told us to ask ourselves throughout the day, "Am I dreaming?"  So, if you asked yourself right now, "Am I dreaming?" you would of course know that you were not. He told us to do this many times a day for a few weeks and that one day, if it worked for us, we would find ourselves in a dream and we would ask ourselves "Am I dreaming?" If we were dreaming, we would then become aware of it because we would realize that we were, indeed, in a dream. \nI did this for a long time and then one night found myself in a dream wherein I was eating a glass mug. This seemed very unusual and not quite right.  Therefore, I asked myself, "Am I dreaming?" and I immediately realized that I was dreaming because there was no way I would be eating glass! I usually awake at the moment I realize I am dreaming, but it always is really neat when I do wake up because I realize I''ve had a lucid dream! \nMy husband, Dr. Laraway from the Udacity Statistics class, also has been able to lucid dream as well. He started out using the same technique. However, he also tells himself before he goes to sleep that if he is having a weird or unusual dream and he "wakes up in it" and he "is not in our bed in our bedroom" that is dreaming. On these occasions, when he realizes that he is in fact dreaming, he tells himself to fly, and he does! I haven''t been that lucky to fly yet, but I keep trying!\nI hope you find this informative! Good luck lucid dreaming!', '02 Jul ''13, 19:13', 1),

They never did get married, and while I am married now, I never had really strong opinions about whether or not I was going to get married in future.  I do think that their relationship, and others in my family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, and so forth) did influence why I waited as long as I did (33).  I wanted to be super-sure that I was making the correct decision for myself if and when it happened.\nThe historical shift in when people tend to get married seems to be directly related to social and world conditions.  It appears that, for instance, in times that directly following war and famine people seem to get married and have children at a younger age.  Maybe they''re more connected to a sense of their own mortality.  In times of relative peace and abundance, people have a chance to take their time with these types of important decisions.\nIn terms of when I got married, I needed to be sure that I was compatible with my spouse, and that he held the same view as I that marriage is not always easy, that it requires work, and that while it may not necessarily be "forever," it is a lifetime commitment that should not be taken lightly.  Aside from those core similarities, I needed to be certain in who I was and that I was able to convey that correctly so there were no surprises.  I''m sure I''d be divorced several times over at this point if I''d married each of the people I was involved with previously up until my current relationship or extremely miserable.', '08 Jul ''13, 20:09', 1),

Skinner, not so much about Chomsky.\nIn response to the "you decide" section, I choose Skinner over Chomsky. Chomsky''s belief that the initial language learning was more of a "discovery" seems ill-fitting to me; is not anything learned in the first few years a "discovery" in and of itself? For instance, besides my native English language, I was also taught to count to 10 in Spanish. I was so young when this happened that I do not recall this learning process. Yet, whenever I was asked, the numbers 1-10 in Spanish would flow from my brain without a fight, in much the same way as I spoke my native language. I did not "discover" these ten words (in my opinion); they were deliberately taught to me, much in the same way that English (at the very least, the grammar aspect) is taught to younglings (consciously or not).\nMy siding with Skinner does not necessarily mean that I believe Skinner''s ideals to be accurate; rather, it is of my opinion that Chomsky''s ideals are considerably less accurate.', '11 Jul ''13, 20:00', 0),

There are 5 levels of difficulty in languages according to the DoD. Russian is a level-4 language. Spanish is level-2. French, German and Italian are level-3s. There is no "level-1" because that''s a person''s native language. For non-English speakers however, English is level-5 as is Arabic. \nI won''t even get into levels of ability.\nFast forward: After two months I began dreaming in Russian.  Later I also began (occasionally) to speak English in an odd structure and meter. Example: I was getting to know this girl and I wanted to ask, "So, where are you from?" --a common ice breaker. But instead, I asked her, "From where do you come" which was a literal English translation of the Russian sentence for the same thing.\nLikewise, my ability to speak Russian improved drastically when I started trying to think, and even affect an accent, like a Russian. The first time I spoke with a heavy accent (like a character from a movie) my teacher stopped still and stared at me, the classroom went quiet --they thought I was being a wise ass (I wasn''t). Still, a part of me thought I was about to be chewed out. Instead, he walked up to me and grabbed my arms and shook them. Then with a big smile he said, "Xorosho!"\nAnyway, that''s my story and I''m stickin'' to it!\nJ', '12 Jul ''13, 00:36', 0),

When discussing the research of others, we use the group names given by the researchers. instead of creating our own group names for their study and their participants.  In this study that was published in 1995, Hart and Risley categorized the children as coming from "professional, middle-class, or welfare" families; therefore, in order to present their study as they described it, we used their terms.  That is, it is not for to us to change the categorization from "welfare families" to "working poor" families because that is not how the original research defined their groups. Also, that distinction was an important part of their group assignment as they specifically wanted to study children who came from families that received government assistance and those that did not ,but that also varied in income (professional vs middle class). Therefore, "welfare families" and "working poor families" are fundamentally different in that one is getting government assistance and the other not. I hope this clarifies for you why we used their group names for describing the study.\nBest,\nDr. Snycerski', '15 Jul ''13, 18:04', 10),

I do not agree with him though, that learning language is like an instinct that we humans have such as walking. He probably means talking is an instinct, if it is so, I do not need to distinguish between talking and language.\nSkinner on the other hand makes more sense because one needs to learn a language. I had to go to school at least 12 times for long periods to learn the languages. I could not acquire them. \nI have another thought: Giacomo Rizzolatti was working with Giuseppe Di Pellegrino and other scientist and during an experiment discovered the existence of mirror neurons in a monkey. This concept was extended to humans and V. S. Ramachandran has spoken a lot about it on TED and elsewhere. Is it possible that children have more mirror neurons up to a certain age? These may help them not only to emulate the adults and their care givers in physical aspects, but enable them to learn the language or languages spoken in their surroundings with such ease that it seems as if they were acquiring them? With age, just as our hearing  ability changes, so it may be that mirror neurons reduce in numbers and then we need to learn the language?\nFascinating stuff, love this course!', '16 Jul ''13, 07:11', 0),

Somehow they managed to have a pretty good marriage - they at least still seem happy together after spending more than half their lifes with each other. \nI don''t know if there is a great / perfect age to marry - a lot of the people I went to school with are married today and some are already divorced.

I actually think that I won''t, with a slight tendency to maybe. If you''d ask me about kids - I''d scream NO. There are many reasons for this - but one is that, if I ever find my maternal instinct, there are a lot of kids out there who deserve a good home without me having to "create" them.\nTo me - the idea of being married and having kids right now is totally crazy. But I just finished my master''s about a year ago - I worked really hard for it and right now I just want to work, to live my life and be truly independent.

As Lauren states in this video, "there is something innately different about those two groups [the early versus later group]." What she means here is that there is likely a fundamental difference between those two groups that is evidenced by when they showed up. For example, if the study is conducted in the morning, maybe the early group is likely to be morning people who, at that time, are more lively and awake than the later group. This could mean they have a faster reaction time. This is just one possible example of a difference in these two groups.

The short answer to your question is no, but I think you''ve conflated two issues:\n1) Every individual has two copies of every gene, one from mom and one from dad (except genes on the X or Y chromosome if you''re a male, and except mitochondrial genes which only come from the mother). So if light and dark colored skin were caused by one gene, then the offspring would have to get a copy of that gene from each parent.\n2) A trait being monogenic doesn''t mean that there isn''t "blending" of traits. Because you have two copies of each allele, if you had a dark copy and a light copy, they could mix to be in-between; or the dark copy could win out over the light copy, or the other way around. It all depends on the kind of copy that it is. This sort of phenomenon is called "dominance" and there are many different categories: complete/simple dominance, codominance, incomplete dominance, etc. Each describes a different interactions between the two copies of a gene. So even if there were only one gene, the differences could combine in many different ways.\nHope this helps clear it up.', '24 Jul ''13, 02:26', 7),

One is convenience: rodents are small, easily housed and maintained, and adapt well to new surroundings. They also reproduce quickly and have a short lifespan of two to three years, so several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short period of time.\nMice and rats are also relatively inexpensive and can be bought in large quantities from commercial producers that breed rodents specifically for research. The rodents are also generally mild-tempered and docile, making them easy for researchers to handle, although some types of mice and rats can be more difficult to restrain than others.\nMost of the mice and rats used in medical trials are inbred so that, other than sex differences, they are almost identical genetically. This helps make the results of medical trials more uniform, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. As a minimum requirement, mice used in experiments must be of the same purebred species.\nAnother reason rodents are used as models in medical testing is that their genetic, biological and behavior characteristics closely resemble those of humans, and many symptoms of human conditions can be replicated in mice and rats. "Rats and mice are mammals that share many processes with humans and are appropriate for use to answer many research questions," said Jenny Haliski, a representative for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.\nRodents also make efficient research animals because their anatomy, physiology and genetics are well-understood by researchers, making it easier to tell what changes in the mice''s behaviors or characteristics are caused by.\n\nBlockquote\n\nI am also looking forward to others thoughts and answers on this topic!', '26 Jul ''13, 13:49', 2),

You might not be able to understand "how" someone can feel this way. And since the majority of people are straight this mindset was pretty much everywhere and so this is "normal" while anything that deviates from "normal" is considered "abnormal". With this way of looking at it, you can view homosexuality as a disorder (which is by definition "abnormal").\nSo, why isn''t homosexualtity a disorder?\nOnce white people thought that people of color (particularly Black-Africans) where simply "stupid" - because what they considered "normal" wasn''t present in a lot of tribes. For example a written language, cloths, or modern tools. The african way of living was "abnormal" to them, so they figuered that this meant black people had fewer mental abilities than white people.\nIn both cases someone decided to impose their world view as the gold standard of "normal".  And in both cases there is no hard and fast evidence to show this assumption is true. There are a lot of smart people who are black (W.A. Lewis won the noble price in economics). And no one was able to show homosexuality as the result of any physiological abnormality. Actually homosexuality has been present though thousands of years (probably always but we can''t prove that) and it is not a "trait" that has been lost through evolution. And in a lot of animals homosexual behavior is pretty normal (giraffes, even primates). \nIf one considers all the research and knowledge today, viewing homosexuality as a disorder is not possible. \nWe (should) know now that even if something isn''t average or present in the majority, it can still be "normal". \nI know that sadly both of the prejudice I described are still around today - it just doesn''t make either one true or proveable.', '01 Aug ''13, 18:50', 3),

So, now is my turn to shed light on this topic.\nIt is a great example, Sylvia, about black people. These two "discriminations" (about black people and homosexual people) have much in common. But your example is very tricky too, because the reasons of these two "discriminations" are completely different.\nFirst of all, let''s see on your example. When white people first time reached Africa they saw some tribes of black people , who didn''t have innovations (like guns, big ships and so on) unlike white people. Europeans gave them cheap things and got jewel. That tribes didn''t have holistic country and so on. So white people thought that black people were silly. But in fact this discrimination was because of lack information. Europeans didn''t know about for example Ethiopia. It was strong and powerful country in that historical period.\nNow about homosexual people. Homosexual people existed in practically all historical periods. Great example of my words would be spartans. An interesting fact, that spartans were gays. As we saw in this course, when you lose somebody whom you love, you''ll get a huge stress. And if spartan died in the fight, his lover gained new strength, new power, he wanted revenge! So in the XX century people had a lot of information about homosexuality so they were guided by another reasons, unlike when people made unfair decision about black race. That time, as I said, they didn''t have enough information.\nAnother your argument, why homosexuality is normal, is "in a lot of animals homosexual behavior is pretty normal". It doesn''t have any sense. Why? Because some animals have sex with their parents. So after some decades you would say that sex with our parents is something normal? It would be a complete disaster!\nThere are a lot of reasons why homosexuality was called abnormal. In my opinion one of the strongest reasons is reproductivity function. I predict that you want to say that love doesn''t have any common with reproductivity. But in some sense it''s wrong. For example brother and sister could love each other, but marriage between them is banned because their children would be weak, ugly and so on. But unlike "family love" gays completely don''t have any children. The definition of species from Wiki: "A species is often defined as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring". Another reasons you could find in google or I''ve found this link.\nGood luck, Sylvia, I hope you have a nice day.

Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Shyness is inherently painful; introversion is not. One reason that people confuse the two concepts is that they sometimes overlap (though psychologists debate to what degree). Some psychologists map the two tendencies on vertical and horizontal axes, with the introvert-extrovert spectrum on the horizontal axis, and the anxious-stable spectrum on the vertical. With this model, you end up with four quadrants of personality types: calm extroverts, anxious (or impulsive) extroverts, calm introverts, and anxious introverts. In other words, you can be a shy extrovert, like Barbra Streisand, who has a larger-than-life personality and paralyzing stage fright; or a nonshy introvert, like Bill Gates, who by all accounts keeps to himself but is unfazed by the opinions of others.\nYou can also, of course, be both shy and an introvert: T. S. Eliot was a famously private soul who wrote in The Waste Land that he could show you fear in a handful of dust. Many shy people turn inward, partly as a refuge from the socializing that causes them such anxiety. And many introverts are shy, partly as a result of receiving the message that theres something wrong with their preference for reflection, and partly because their physiologies, as well see, compel them to withdraw from high-stimulation environments. But for all their differences, shyness and introversion have in common something profound. The mental state of a shy extrovert sitting quietly in a business meeting may be very different from that of a calm introvertthe shy person is afraid to speak up, while the introvert is simply overstimulatedbut to the outside world, the two appear to be the same. This can give both types insight into how our reverence for alpha status blinds us to things that are good and smart and wise. For very different reasons, shy and introverted people might choose to spend their days in behind-the-scenes pursuits like inventing, or researching, or holding the hands of the gravely illor in leadership positions they execute with quiet competence. These are not alpha roles, but the people who play them are role models all the same."\nThis quote should clear up many doubts.', '05 Aug ''13, 08:15', 0),

So you can lose your memories during an event because this point in the past is just after this event, or this event was so traumatic that caused you having retrograde amnesia, that includes forgetting this very event.\nFor example, when I was a child I was run over by a car, and I''ve never remembered this accident (I only haver memories from the hospital), and it''s possible that I also lost some memories from before the accident, which would be retrograde amnesia.', '07 Aug ''13, 09:27', 2),

Brown is the dominant gene while blue is the recessive. So say your grandma has brown eyes and your grandpa has blue. Since your mom has brown eyes, in this example, brown is expressed but she''s also a carrier for blue eyes. We write this as Bb, B is brown and b is blue. Your dad would just be bb because if he had a big B, he''d automatically have brown eyes (Brown is dominant, remember?). Now when you and your siblings were made, half your eye color genes came from mom and half from dad. We would write this as Bb x bb. Now taking one from mom and one from dad, possible offspring eye color combinations are Bb, Bb, bb, and bb or just Bb and bb. In other words, 50% brown and 50% blue. So, you''d expect for half of you guys to have brown eyes and half blue, right? Actually, it''s more like each kid has a 50/50 chance of having brown or blue. In your guys case, it''s like someone flipped a coin a bunch of times and it kept landing on heads. Though this seems unlikely, the result of the current coin flip has nothing to do with the previous one. Genetics is messy and confusing, but I hope this is helpful. If not, feel free to ask questions. For everyone else, if you can find a simpler way to explain or find any mistakes in this explanation, I myself would be extremely grateful.', '07 Aug ''13, 09:40', 0),

There can be different degrees sometimes it''s difficult to decide where to draw the line.

The developmental stage should also be taken into account in order to understand what is reasonably expected of a kid. Obviously, just having a fidgety kid doesn''t automatically mean they have ADHD. If I remember, there are also different types of ADD so hyperactivity doesn''t always have to be the defining feature of an ADD child.\nAnd while it is true that some are misdiagnosed and that there are some parents that could take more responsibility, I imagine it''s harder to ask for therapy than for medication and that insurance is more likely to cover medication. Sometimes it''s not a parent''s willingness, it''s also a struggle for them because of the resources available or the information they''ve been given. I think it''s better to take the therapy when possible because of what it does in the long run and leave medication as the last thing you go to.\nAnd as for the reported increase in diagnosis in the USA, I''ve heard conflicting things but I go to an international school and I know that diagnostic criteria is tighter in some countries (ie England) than in others.

Sometimes I feel there is not enough relevant information in simple multiple choice questions, while if you were in an actual class or even an online class you could email the instructor and say, "well, is anybody coordinating groups? Are people arriving at the same time?" Because if you just emailed all the participants and said "this experiment will begin at 8" and then did assign them by who arrived first, it would produce two random groups of equal size.  Flipping a coin isn''t that great because like Conor said if one group size is significantly larger than the other it weakens the results of your findings. \nKate', '17 Aug ''13, 11:36', 0),

('100105532', '100070783', 'users/137736360/vipin-2', 'Working memory is an advanced concept  which replaced the general concept of short term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short term storage. Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics. \nWorking memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad and the episodic buffer. The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again) which makes a short list of data easier to remember. The visuo-spatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging heights or distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining architectural plans or images). The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and "executive" functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a essay or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.\nWhen considering the frontal lobes in regards to memory, we see that it is very important in the coordination of information. Therefore, the frontal lobes are important in working memory. For example, when you are thinking about how to get to a new city you have never been to before, you combine various bits of knowledge you already have: the layout of the city, information from a map, knowledge of traffic patterns in that area and conversations with your friends about the location of the city. By actively using all of this information, you can determine the best route for you to take. This action involves the controlled use of information in working memory, coordinated by the frontal lobes. \nThe hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia).Damage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory, such as the ability to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory (procedural memory) and different brain regions. Brain imaging shows that people have more active hippocampi when correctly navigating, as tested in a computer-simulated "virtual" navigation task or spatial skills. There is inherent connection between frontal lobe and hippocampus for proper coordination of short term memory.', '20 Aug ''13, 05:18', 1),

Shy men encounter more difficulties in life than shy women. In some cultures women are even preferred to be shy and obedient, whereas men tend to be active, assertive, sociable and independent in all aspects of life. If a man is shy you can assume that he has some problems in his personal life. Shy men are often less sociable and friendly , they fear to be rejected by women. As a result, they can even experience troubles with sex. Shy women tend to find a partner as sooner as possible to get rid of the complex of shyness, because with a partner she feels much more comfortable, self-confident and attractive towards the opposite sex.', '24 Aug ''13, 01:14', 4),

Why did our brain store something useless ,in this case, the childhood memory, for so long even though it wasn''t needed, while we forgot something we actually needed to remember, in this case, the person''s name)?\nFor learning, it could possible have the same meaning. Cognitive Neuroscience might elaborate on how we learn, and Cognitive Psychology might discuss why some methods of learning work for some, but not for others (like some people learn better when they take notes or read aloud from textbooks, or listen to an audio recording of a lecture, while some learn best when they draw representative diagrams, charts and watch the lesson as a video)\nSo I think while Cognitive Neuroscience teaches us the how, Cognitive Psychology teaches us the why.\nBut while there isn''t an extremely large distinction between the two, differences can be made out in most cases I think.', '31 Aug ''13, 12:05', 3),

The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders."\nThe question isn''t whether or not there was a tragedy that occurred. The question is whether or not the apartment residents did nothing and whether or not a large number of bystanders were present. If you read the Superfreakonomics bit (or better yet, the article in the September 2007 American Psychologist by Manning et al) you''d know that the apartment residents did in fact intervene: they called the police, they chased away Moseley and they saw that Kitty had gotten away. You could argue that the residents should have gotten together and formed a search party to seek out Kitty and make sure she received adequate help. Then again, we do pay our police to respond to emergencies when we call them.\nThe only evidence that the Genovese murder is an example of the bystander effect comes from Gansberg''s NY Times article. You said that I''ve given too much weight to one source, but (let me repeat) the ONLY evidence that the Genovese murder is an example of the bystander effect comes from Gansberg''s NY Times article. In all versions it is a horrible tragedy, but the bystander effect is something very specific. There are a lot of subsequent writings that use that article as their source. But those aren''t new sources providing new data or evidence. It''s just people repeating what they''ve read elsewhere. (Superfreakonomics and Manning et al 2007 both provide new data and don''t just take Gansberg''s article at face value) The reasons why I am not willing to trust that source is that it is factually inaccurate (e.g. claiming that there were three separate attacks, when there were only two) and that the source used was a police inspector trying to cover up the fact that his police force had been extremely slow to respond to an emergency.\nThe Kitty Genovese tragedy is still a horrible tragedy. What Julien and I were saying is that it is not a good example of the bystander effect because the apartment residents did in fact intervene.\nSo, my question to you would be: what evidence do you have that the Genovese case is actually an example of the bystander effect (and not just a horrible tragedy) other than what a police commissioner told a NY Times reporter in order to hide the fact that the police were slow to respond to the call(s) they received after the first attack?', '25 Sep ''13, 14:55', 1),

Recently I''ve seen a video called "Developers and Depression".\nIt''s a very good talk, and I suggest everyone to watch it.  Around minute 7, Greg talks about a book he read:\nThe Edison Gene: ADHD and the Gift of the Hunter Child.\nIn this book, they identify two different types of people: hunters and farmers. Hunters keep shifting attention, farmers are methodical and meticulous. They argue that modern society favours today the farmers type. \nLinear thinkers vs non-linear thinkers. Non-linear thinkers focus in situations of stress and danger.\nIn modern society, we don''t face those types of situations much, but rather we need to show up on time, be meticulous...\nLater on, Greg says that the software industry is more accepting of the hunter personality, it''s often ok to wake up late, be productive at night, having long periods of poor productivity followed by burst of hyperactivity.\nThis talk has explained to me how hunters and farmers are both present in the industry. Perhaps: implementers and maintainers? \nThe point of the talk though, is that as a whole an extreme hunter type of personality is less productive, and faces social problems and even bigger risks of suicide.\nMedical help is available, through drugs and psychotherapy if the very hard first step of searching for help is taken.', '01 Oct ''13, 08:07', 0),

Then they were trying to conclude if meditation has an effect on the brain tissue growth.,i.e they were studying the resultant brain tissue growth in the 2 groups.Thus it is clear that brain tissue growth is the dependent variable here.Finally the studies showed that the group which meditated showed a growth in their brain tissues.Therefore a cause was established.

Amidst a time of natural science and seeing patients as machines he explored and applied his "talking treatment"(1893) in order to change the whole person to the cure. \nPsychology is studying the behavior and mental processes of individuals scientifically. Of course today there are other standards to what science is but in his time he was scientific in discovering the irrational. He had interesting hypotheses which are already incorporated in the way we see things, he was very experimental in his sessions though we imagine wrongly, of course observant and his thinking still remains clear in his works. As fashionable as Freud bashing has become (that it has even seeped into therapy training programs), Freud too was not always wrong. Some hypotheses have even proven to be right: Freud not only invented but also posited the fundamentals of psychotherapy: the value of insight and deep self-exploration and expression; the existence of resistance, transference, repressed trauma; the use of dreams and fantasies, role playing, free association; the need to address characterological problems as well as symptoms; and the absolute necessity of a trusting therapeutic relationship.\nHe can be seen as a neuroscientist who worked as an explorer and clinical psychologist even though the institutionalization of what he did still needed to be done. The practical psychologists came before the approved. In the USA you could get a certificate(formal education) for psychology from 1927 till 1932 and after that it was not until the 1950ies where it has become possible to get a formal education in this field. Quite to the contrary the term psychology was used about 1520 for the very first time and the beginnings of science and psychology and their application go way back, to the ancient greek world. And even seen over this time span Freud''s revolutionaly insights and contributions to culture, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy remain unparalleled. He prefigured many of the major developments that were to occur over the next one hundred years.', '24 Oct ''13, 14:54', 3),

But the emotions you attributed in the process of appraisal is dependent on your genes and your temperament(personality). How you appraise the situation also depends on the social environment. If your social environment doesn''t induce certain values, doesn''t let you be autonomous or gives you poor instruction quality or no feedback you are quite unlikely to have or develop certain values or the thought that you might be able to control the situation of have control in general. This means the social environment directly influences(i.e. over feedback and consequences) your general believes and aims which are the background of your situational appraisal but also influence your temperament and your epigenetics(!!) which in turn influence your achievementmotivation. Which influence your emotions and therefore the appraisal of control and value in the situation.\nWith this model I can be more specific in answering your question: achievement motivation, which stands on a changeable base influences the appraisal of the situation but your general believes and aims  and your social environment also determine how you appraise the situation. This appraisal (together with your genetics and temperament) determine your motivation and emotions.\nwhen you''re talking about "motivation from challenge" you might be referring to a generalized believe which is controlled by the feedbacks and consequences of your social environment.', '10 Nov ''13, 09:26', 1),

('100132042', '100104615', 'users/100029839/viliam-bur', 'Human eyes process colors as if in two steps. In the first step, the wavelenght of the light is translated to signals of (three types of) cones. In the second step, the signals from the different types of cones are combined to produce a perception of the color.\nThe perception of color is not directly a signal from one type of a cone, but rather a combination of signals. For example, think about the red color. In your picture, there is no type of cone that would have a maximum at red. The RED line actually has its maximum at yellow, and then towards the red it decreases; it just decreases slower than the other lines. So the perception of a yellow color is something like "high RED signal, medium GREEN signal, no BLUE signal", while the perception of a red color is something like "medium RED signal, no GREEN signal, no BLUE signal". It''s not just the presence of RED signal,but also the absence of GREEN signal that together create the perception of a red color.\nNow look at the picture carefully and tell me where else is the RED signal higher than the GREEN signal. Yeah, it happens a bit near the violet end of the scale. At which point our eye perceives a blue color as "high BLUE signal, medium GREEN signal, a bit lower RED signal", and a violet color as "high BLUE signal, medium GREEN signal, a bit higher RED signal".\nSpeaking about wavelenghts, violet is at the opposite end of our scale. But speaking about signals from the cones, there is a similarity between how they react on a red color and a violet color: in both cases, the RED signal is stronger than the GREEN signal. So despite the wavelenghts are different, they happen to translate to signals with some similar traits. Which creates an illusion of similarity. But it''s an illusion; an artifact of how human eyes work.\nThe violet light is not a mix of red and blue lights. But the cone signals triggered by the violet light are a mix of signals triggered by red and blue lights. By mixing a pure red light and a pure blue light, you can create a mixed light that a human eye would perceive as a violet color. But it wouldn''t be the same thing as a pure violet light. (You could tell the difference using a prism: the mixed blue+red light would again split to its component, while the pure violet light wouldn''t split.) A different species and some partially colorblind people would see them as different colors.\nSummary: A wavelength is not the same thing as a color. Wavelength is a physical property of a photon. Color is a simplification of a combination of wavelengths, a feeling computed by human cones. Different combinations of wavelengths can result in a perceptions of the same color. For example, a mix of blue and red wavelengths can create the same color as a violet wavelength, despite being a different physical thing. This is actually how television and computer screens create an illusion of all colors using only three wavelengths. The three colors in RGB correspond to the the three types on cones in the average human eye; this is not an inherent physical property of light. A different species would have different perceptions of color.\nIf you think about the signals, it also helps to explain how colorblind people see. For example imagine that someone does not have the GREEN signal. (For genetic reasons, they simply don''t have this type of a cone, or it''s damaged and unable to process signals correctly.) For them, both green color and red color are perceived like "no BLUE signal, medium RED signal", so in the result they both look the same. This is the most frequent type of partial color blindness. (Theoretically speaking, from a different species'' point of view, our inability to see the difference between violet and blue+red would also be considered a partial color blindness shared by all humans.)', '01 Dec ''13, 05:32', 2),

Thus, negative reinforcement means rewarding someone by removing something (that they dislike), and negative punishment means punishing someone by removing something (that they like).\nIt has absolutely no connection with bad things or with negative electric charge. :D\nI guess when people speak about conditioning, they would not use the word "negative" to mean bad behavior, because that would be confusing. They would probably just speak about the behavior without expressing judgement, or use a different word e.g. "undesired".', '11 Dec ''13, 12:08', 1),

I mean for example for me the monetary success or social acceptance doesnt mean nothing, while i really care about the individual, innovative and good side of the person. And believe me i have something like an unconsciousness defense mechanism about people who tend to use others, or fake things or feelings etc.\n\n\nHere really depends on your perception of the world. If you are a critic person, who thinks and examines his own behavior, or the others behavior, you may found yourself wanting to change way of acting, or interacting with the world wery often. While on the other hand you may just be ok with who you are, and just not want to change anything.\n\n\nThis is really a hard question and i think that there is not an exact answer to this question. I mean, i changed since i finished school 3 years ago more than 4 jobs, and usually i get bored and tired of any job, in the same moment when i stop learning from what i do.

Why, why, so many people whenever they are told about "disorder" or "deviation" immediately conclude that this is something bad?\nOften when I argue for the fact that homosexuality is a disorder I immediately get blamed for "thinking that I am better than homosexual", "being homophobic", "being fascist", "saying that homosexual people are bad". My next question to such people is whether they consider person with diabetes as being somehow inferior or bad? They generally say no. So why they assume that thinking that homosexuality is a disorder make homosexual people inferior?\nSo I think from the beginning we should have been fighting the whole idea of discrimination towards people with disorders. As long as disorder does not make person dangerous to other people. Instead of this we chose different way - fighting to prove that specific disorders are not disorders. Now we are getting to the point of recognizing that sexual attraction to children is not a disorder, sexual attraction to animals is not a disorder - do people start to realize that maybe we just chose a wrong road?\nI do support fighting against discrimination of gay people, but I think that it is a mental disorder and my opinion is unlikely to change (I don''t want to put my arguments here, because this is not the main point I want to highlight).

Then I did two of the alternatives explained in the lesson, I got new knowledge (new for me, of course) about love and confidence, also I had some teraphy sessions and, the second was that I changed my behavior, I open my mind, heard a lot of books and people (mainly my wife) and step by step I changed the way that I communicate with my sun. \nToday, my relatioship with him is very different, now he feel well with me, talk to me and let me know his worries and ideas, I was able to grew as father and get more skills as better listener and not be so faultfinder. I guess this is a recent a very good example about the topic. And I''m very proud about me and my sun, because we work hard (with the support of all the family) and we were able to resolve the problem putting in first place the love between us.  The main goal for me is that now, he has a better behavior not because I pushed him, instead because he decided to get it, I want to think that my example did some part of the job, but that''s just my hope. \nThanks for the space to share this.', '04 Feb ''14, 10:08', 0),

It started out from the minerals and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals. The last stage of minerals is connected with the first stage of plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last stage of plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first stage of animals, such as snails and shellfish which have only the power of touch. The word ''connection'' with regard to these created things means that the last stage of each group is fully prepared to become the first stage of the newest group.\nThe animal world then widens, its species become numerous, and, in a gradual process of creation, it finally leads to man, who is able to think and reflect. The higher stage of man is reached from the world of monkeys, in which both sagacity and perception are found, but which has not reached the stage of actual reflection and thinking.

Writing down and focusing on what you appreciate and feel grateful for will help take your mind off sadness too.\nAnother interesting way it mentioned to get rid of negative energy is using the ''tapping technique'' that Roger Callaham developed.

Sometimes I think, that 30 might be a good age but sometimes I do not see the importance of getting married at all. And this is not because I have not found the right person. It is more because I have the feeling that thinking about marriage has changed in my generation. \nFor me there are several reasons for this. It might sound banal, but I still think that the women''s movement had a great impact on how especially women are living now. In earlier times it was simply the idea of society that you as a woman got married as soon as possible, because you needed the security of a husband taking especially financially care of you to "unburden" your family (besides the fact that of course love-marriage was possible!). Most of the women did not work at that time so they did not earn money to support the family. And when it was not for money reason, in richer families status was a criteria for finding the right husband/wife. This is also, why so many movies and books tell us about cross-status-border marriages. People were forced by society to marriage for something they did not always belive in.\nBut starting with my parents generation, society accepted working women and thus they became more independently from men. Their was not necessarily a restraint to get married because of financial security. Now, one was really able to choose and wait for somebody, that is right for one self. And as society grew more and more tolerant, there came up also same-gender, cross-cultural and cross-social-status and enriched our lifes by the freedom of choice when it comes to partners. And this progress is something we all should support as it is a release for everyone who does not "meet" society''s expectations. \nThis is the great advantage that I now still have: All magazines and blogs are talking about finding Mister right, downloading the best dating app and doing speed dating in your homecity. Because we are looking for our right match in personality, character, interestets and beliefs. Not (only) for our financial match. I have to admit that money is not the only important factor but it is the factor that strokes me the most when I was thinking about his topic. Money and security. And surely the women''s movement is not the only movement that influenced marriage. There are many other movements, that concentrated on all kinds of discrimination besides sex-only. They all have an impact on how we think of marriage today. So please see the women''s movement as on sample out of many.\nThe most important factors for me to be sure of are now that my partner is the right one for me. That he supports and respects me the way I am. And also, that I can see, that he will do this in future. For me, there are no quantitative factors to evaluate this but more qualitative factors such as love, trust and happiness. And here it comes to the point: Marriage is about feelings not about status. But maybe this is not how it was intented to be earlier. So that now has changed our image of marriage, maybe we have to think about the definition of marriage and if it still represents what we think of as marriage.', '15 Apr ''14, 07:50', 0),

I myself occasionally fall for them, but try never to invest too much time and effort into something that is ''too good to be true''. \nFrom day one, I suspected this would happen, even thought that the free material would go away (it does cost money to stream video data) but I believe we were promised it would always be free, so that is only what I have counted on.   Unlike Anurag, I did not prosyletize for Udacity (I did somewhat for Coursera, but in my opinion they had a better platform (did not rely on YouTube, allowed easier video downloads etc) and I do not regret telling people about Coursera).  However, they too have gone the way of ''Verified Certificates" costing a reasonable amount ($49 last I checked).   They do have standard certificates for free, and that is fine by me.  If they stop issuing them, I will be less motivated to use their services but no more motivated to pay for a certificate because I question their value.\nThe cost of certificates is simply a tax on dishonesty paid by the honest.  If the potential employer does not believe me when I say I have completed the course successfully, then he or she probably won''t believe me when I say I worked 55 hours that week, etc.  In other words, not sure I would want to work for anyone like that.   Sure, someone could pay someone else to take the course for them, but that would be a little stupid, and in any case, there is nothing that would 100% prevent that from happening with the current system.   The only thing it does is sort people by how much money they have.   Which is nothing new to us in the U.S.   \nI expect any day for Google to start charging for gmail and when they do that, I will quit using it (after downloading all my emails).', '07 May ''14, 11:13', 4),

It''s explained pretty well HERE, but I''ll try to sum it up:\nIt''s a matter of definitions.\nWe have LOUDNESS, which is a subjective term, derived from subjective perception.\nWe have VOLTAGE, which can be objectively measured via the observation of the sound pressure level within a specific sound field.\nAnd we have the ACOUSTIC INTENSITY, which is defined as the sound power per unit. This includes subjective factors, such as ear sensitivity, with objective factors, such as VOLTAGE. It''s a theoretical definition which tries to measure how noisy will a noise be for an individual''s ear, from a medical point of view.\nNOW, as it seems,\nLOUDNESS doubles itself with each 10dB increase.\nVOLTAGE doubles itself with (approximately) each 6dB increase.\nACOUSTIC INTENSITY grows 10 times with each 10dB increase.\nSo I guess the folks at udacity meant to say that, if you ask a person, he''ll say that a 60dB sound sounded 2 times as strong as a 50dB sound.\nThanks for the question dude, that''s interesting.

When women are more confident in general they think they will definitely find a mate in time before the clock of eggs starts to tick and so she parties around more.  In older times women had been taught to take time very seriously and get a good man soon.  A woman who is less confident will listen to this instinct more.\nAnd with men this biological instinct isn''t there because they can pretty much always have children.  \nAlso since the feminist era women have been less humble in terms of family in general and are more selective about a mate.  This has given men in general a hard blow on their self esteem, except for the few in the top ten or twenty percent who women will gravitate to.  Because they are out of place in this world now except by perpetuating the negative roles of partier, sexual relations that are not based on any serious commitments.   Because to be the noble man who wants to have a family life, can at times be an upward battle particularly if he is of more homely appearance and behavior.  He could find himself completely alone.

This just means that whenever you look at a coping strategy you ask yourself: does it remove the causes which come in your way(=instrumental) or not(even Greg didn''t work on the feelings he had towards the waves). And you too ask yourself whether the coping is working on the environment(alloplastic) or working on yourself(on your emotions for example).\nSo in the example of Greg and Lauren: instrumental solving of the problem is only possible in the autoplastic domain. (With their resources they can''t change the reasons for the annoying tides). Which means: when Greg tries invention(as he did by thinking) his actions(thinking) could only be palliative(could only lead to frantic thinking). Similar to this he could also engage in aggression(get into a state of rage) or start to cry(supplication) anyway those three strategies are only possible in the palliative here. This might be what you call "not problem-focused".\nLauren looked for a solution in the autoplastic domain and opted for revision. But even in this category she could have picked the denial that there would be tides at all. Which also would not be very instrumental. But in fact she picked the instrumental revision called reappraisal.\nThe key thing when thinking about coping always is to know which problem you are looking at(in the example with Lauren and Greg getting rid of the annoyance by tides should have been worked out more clearly) and to know where the possible instrumental solutions are. Either in the alloplastic or in the things you can change in yourself(autoplastic). Sometimes you can change things in both fields. But there''s always a palliative way to it in each strategy.\nCoping normally tries to be instrumental in the first place. But if it isn''t(can not be) functional over time the dysfunctional state of distress could do damage. So if you don''t change strategy(to one which can become instrumental) you will then atomatically switch over to the palliative version of the strategy (e.g. if begging for support doesn''t help and you stay in the strategy of supplication you will palliatvely get into a fit of crying).\nMarcus', '21 May ''14, 08:11', 0),

As well as the normal sheet music, the pitch of each note was expressed by numbers so even untrained people like my family could play. One particular song had a mistake that was a whole full note out but my dad could not hear it even though we pointed it out to him. Whenever he sang it was equally out of tune. But when I was a teenager he joined a local amateur choir. At first he was told to sing very quietly because of being so badly out of tune and we all thought he was hopeless. I moved out but a few years later he surprised me by singing in tune as well as any "normal" person. Not only that but it even sounded pleasant! Now I believe that ANYONE can learn to sing. At least well enough for it to sound pleasing to the ear.

We are both practically endangered species, apes endangered by us and us by ourselves.\nThere doesn''t really need to be a conflict between your religious beliefs and modern science. The people who wrote the bible did so without the knowledge of modern science and in writing a book which was serve as moral guidance to people they also tried to impose an understanding on the universe. But they didn''t have telescopes or microscopes so the world was flat and God made everything in six days. But I would like to think that the wisdom of these writers was more subtle than that, so far as if you are thumping a bible against a proven fact in science, then there may be a very real chance you have just misinterpreted the bible or at the very least missed the point it was trying to make. \nHere are two quotes from both religious men about scripture and science which I think are very interesting, One a church father and one a celebrated scientist that proved the Copernican Heliocentric model of our solar system (albeit with changes to the nature of the proposed orbits.. I don''t know, I''m not an astronomer.)\n"It seems to me that it was well said by Madama Serenissima, and insisted on by your reverence, that the Holy Scripture cannot err, and that the decrees therein contained are absolutely true and inviolable. But I should have in your place added that, though Scripture cannot err, its expounders and interpreters are liable to err in many ways; and one error in particular would be most grave and most frequent, if we always stopped short at the literal signification of the words. " - Galileo Galilei \n" Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion." - Saint Augustine.', '28 May ''14, 14:05', 1),

So we have been trying many different methods, from making comments in the instructor''s notes to making PDFs with corrections, etc. There are also limitations in the technology of how/when to modify videos. Please know that we hear your concerns and take them seriously; we''re constantly working to make this a better experience.\nFrom a strictly pedagogical point of view, mistakes are not all bad either.

Typically when it happens in a live classroom it is missed and will never be corrected ... at least here there is a chance that it will be caught and corrected. And that process of correcting is the BEST learning experience of all. Education research shows us that when you find an error, the effort it takes to discover, research, and rectify the error is a huge boon to your learning about that specific topic.

However, there is a new study showing that brain is indeed necessary - we all know that lack of sleep can cause headache andslowed reactions, as if being drunk. It affects the heart and prolonged total lack of sleep apparently causes death faster then lack of food. And this is why: \nTaking Out the Trash\nThe purpose of sleep remains mysterious. Using state-of-the-art in vivo two-photon imaging to directly compare two arousal states in the same mouse, Xie et al. (p. 373; see the Perspective by Herculano-Houzel) found that metabolic waste products of neural activity were cleared out of the sleeping brain at a faster rate than during the awake state. This finding suggests a mechanistic explanation for how sleep serves a restorative function, in addition to its well-described effects on memory consolidation.\nAbstract\nThe conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a vital function. We here report that sleep has a critical function in ensuring metabolic homeostasis. Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60% increase in the interstitial space, resulting in a striking increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of -amyloid clearance during sleep. Thus, the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.\nReceived for publication 30 May 2013.\nAccepted for publication 28 August 2013.\nhttp://m.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/373\nThe more tightly the brain is packed, or maybe it is the size compared to body mass, could explain why differentspecies need different amounts of sleep?', '23 Jun ''14, 00:32', 0),

But then these 2 cells further divide using meiosis. This gives us a total of 4 cells and each with 23 chromosomes. A normal cell would have 23 pairs of chromosome. Also during this process a small part of the gene is mutated on purpose. How this happens is one part of the allele is taken and replaced with another. If the allele are identical, nothing happens.

Within my family growing up, I was always described (and felt I was) a down-to-earth, intelligent, strong, stable person, a mediator, neutral, conscientious, a strong sense of morality.  Outside of the family, I was perceived and treated very differently, which knocked me to my core, fell off my foundations, I completely lost myself and my identity, &amp; still struggle with this to this day.  This was most especially so during a period of estrangement from my family for a couple of years.  \nSo I completely agree, family helps to develop your core values and personality, and keeps you strong if nothing else then by the sheer knowledge and knowing that they are there and care for you unconditionally. But I would say the external sources have the largest overall contribution to your sense of identity, further development of personality, and your overall experiences and opportunities in life.  \nSomeone who isn''t easily socially accepted may have less positive experiences - even possibly more negative experiences - &amp; therefore less opportunities, which may lead to an overall negative, depressed or anxious outlook on life, which can then become a cycle and integrated into the personality, even affecting emotional stability.  \nSomeone accepted easily may be more likely to have more positive experiences and more opportunities as result, and parts of their personality would shape very differently as a result, as opposed to someone who has more negative experiences.\nJust out loud thoughts, I guess these could change with further learning, experiences and studies.  Or perhaps not everything above could be considered to do with personality.', '27 Aug ''14, 03:53', 0),

Thrun responded to this petition by downplaying the certificate and indicating the education is the important part (which is generally correct). However, if the certificate is not important, why do we need to pay to get it?\nSecondly, in the Q&amp;A, Thrun says that only 10% of people who take the free classes without personal help actually finish the class. Maybe it''s me, but doesn''t that seem worthy of earning a certificate if you''re part of that 10%? Says a lot about your motivation, your drive and your abilities, IMO.\nWhile the education is clearly the more important part, the certificate has value itself as well. I have noticed before there are sites that pull your certificates from various online education and creates a portfolio, even with the ability to add it to LinkedIn. Which in turn easily summarizes for potential employers the direction you are going with online education, and what courses you''ve completed. Maybe most potential employers don''t actually care that much, but based on my experience they do care at least a little bit, as I''ve used that to show my initiative as well as my passion for computer science in interviews.\nI guess I don''t see why Udacity can''t simply have separate "free" and "verified" certificates that have different qualifications, but ultimately both verify that the course was completed.', '11 Dec ''14, 12:25', 2),

('100267670', '100173656', 'users/357058315/s-668457', 'First I''d like to start off by saying:\n"Thanks Udacity and all those involved ( partners, employees, others )" for all you''ve done and are doing** to help those, who appreciate your services, to enrich and improve not only their lives, but the lives of those around them.\nI have some really " BIG " dreams and Udacity is helping me achieve those dreams and turn them into a reality.\nFor that I am eternally grateful.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks Udacity &amp; Dave Evans for sharing the information and knowledge presented in the course "Introduction to Computer Science" !!!\nDave is a phenomenal instructor.  I like his teaching and presentation style.  Very easy to grasp, comprehend and process new information.\nThanks for providing exceptional tools and resources to learn, practice and develop new skills and talents.\nI was looking for a place to start learning Python and this is the perfect course.\nWhat makes this course so unique is there''s an incredible project ( webcrawler &amp; search engine ) that will  be created once course is completed.\n\n\nOnline experience and Python IDE are some of best, if not the best, bar-none.\n\n\nWebsite is very reliable\na. So far, I''ve never been disconnected nor did session timeout or log me out unexpectedly.\nb. Whatever I type in the individual quiz screens is persistent across logins.  Awesome !!!\n\n\nEverything one needs is readily available.\n\n\nUdacity has eliminated all issues. Just bring a hunger and desire to learn.\na. can start course immediately\nb. no distractions due to setting up or prep\nc. everything student needs has been provided\nd. no need to purchase software\ne. no need to purchase equipment ( pc, laptop, tablet )\nf. no time wasted with interoperability / incompatibility issues ( installing &amp; configuring software )\n\n\nThanks again for the magnanimous gesture, selfless act of benevolence and generosity in providing an avenue via which millions like myself have access to resources that can enrich our lives and the lives of others around us.\nSupport has been good too.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks Cameron Pittman and Jessica Uelmen for the absolutely Awesome and Incredible training and learning experience received in "Intro to HTML and CSS ".   Not only did I learn more than I ever imagined or anticipated, but the course had hilarious moments.\nThe final project was extremely challenging, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately very satisfying when I was able to create a mockup that matched 99.83% when superimposed on top of the original design.\nI paid for the certificate, not because I wanted to prove to someone I took the course; I paid for the certificate to demonstrate and show my appreciation and how grateful I was for the structured training, resources provided, knowledge and experienced gain, time and energy saved.\nPrior to taking this course, I knew practically " nothing " about HTML and CSS.\nAfter completing this course I walked away knowing infinitely more about Web Page Design.\nIt feels good to learn something new.  It feels good to feel good.  It feels good to feel competent and confident.  I look forward to continuing the journey; learning, comprehending and retaining so much more while utilizing and implementing what I''ve been taught along the way.\nFollowing are just a " few " of the items I learned while taking this course:\n\n\nSignificance and importance of Separation: HTML ( Layout ), CSS ( Style ), JavaScript ( behavior )\n\n\nBox Layout, Grid Design, CSS Frameworks, BootStrap\n\n\nResponsive  and Adaptive Web Pages using media queries and layout.\na. Responsive design: designing website or page to fit device screen ( portrait or landscape ).\nb. Adaptive design: designing layout so it''s easier for mobile device users who use their fingers, not a mouse.\n\n\nMockups\na. How to look at a Web Page, Picture or PDF, visualize it''s layout, create a mockup\nb. How to use browser web developer tools to inspect and change various items on a page\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThanks Sarah Sproehnle , Ian Wrigley, Gundega Dekena and Cloudera for creating, presenting and offering "Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce".\nThanks to Doug Cutting creator of Hadoop and Chief Architect at Cloudera for sharing about Hadoop''s history and origins.\nI never imagined that within one week I''d developed a very solid foundation and learn the basics about Hadoop and MapReduce.\nUsing the Virtual Machine and data sets they provided, I was able to write Mapper and Reducer code.\nI learned:\n\nWhat is Big Data\nChallenges of Big Data\nThree V''s of Big Data : ( Volume, Variety, Velocity )\nHadoop''s  Origin and History\nHadoop''s Core\nHadoop''s Ecosystem\nHadoop Commands\nDataNodes, NameNodes, Job Trackers, Task Trackers, Input Split, Intermediate Data, Shuffle &amp; Sort, ...\nRole and function of Mappers, Reducers\nHadoop Streaming : Creating code with languages other than Java. ( input &amp; output via stdin &amp; stdout )\nHow to input and export data to and from Hadoop ( HDFS )\nHow to create Mapper and Reducer Code and verify code before submitting jobs.\nHow to submit Hadoop jobs and check results.\n.\n.\nAnd a whole lot more.\n\nI plan to pay for certificate once I complete course in next week or so.  Again, I choose to pay, not because I want to prove to someone I completed the course, but I want to show my appreciation and gratitude for all Udacity has done in making these " invaluable &amp; precious " resources available.  For connecting me to resources ( people, tools, services, ideas, thoughts, information, instruction, training, knowledge, etc... ) that I would possibly never be exposed to and especially not for free.\nI will use this knowledge, wisdom and skills acquired to learn even more about Hadoop and MapReduce.\nPerhaps some day in the not too distant future, I''ll know enough to setup, install and configure a Hadoop cluster, populate it with "meaningful" data and create code to process and analyze that data, then present it on a webpage in a dashboard so it can be easily understood and appreciated by it''s intended audience.\nThe courses I''m taking here at Udacity are enabling me to perform the above in a rather short time for an exceptional and incomprehensible low price ( $0 for the Knowledge, Training &amp; Experience and ~$200 USD for the privilege to get a certificate ).  Not to mention, most of the prerequisite courses needed by those not familiar with the technology or course material to complete the final projects required for the certifications is free.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI''m grateful for all the services Udacity provides.\nWe''re very fortunate Udacity offers the training for free.\nI think it''s completely fair and reasonable for Udacity to charge for Certificates.\nI will pay for all certificates I plan to pursue as it''s a small token of appreciation for all the services Udacity provides and gives away for free.\nI''ve not seen any other training, online, free or otherwise that compares...\nUdacity saves me money and time by not having to:\na. Pay ridiculous tuition fees\nb. Paying for parking on campus or street\nc. Commuting to and from campus ( gas, time and/or fare )\nd. Searching for place to park once reach campus\ne. Spend time walking to / from parking to class\nf. Waiting for class to get started, because teacher or students are late\ng. Classes typically last hour or two depending on day or night classes.\nh. Classes may or may not be available every day, some are twice or three times a week. \ni. Udacity is available 24x7.  I can study at my own pace, 5-6, 8-10 or 12-16 hours per day.\nj. The " Final  Projects " and exercises Udacity provides are superb.  There is no comparison.\nk. At best other educational institutions are nervous and will try to replicate &amp; mimic Udacity''s format.\nWhen taking Intro to Computer Science with Python:\na. I like the IDE\nb. I didn''t have to search for an appropriate editor\nc. I didn''t have to spend cycles on how to use editor\nd. I was able to jump in and get started immediately\ne. I didn''t have to purchase any hardware nor software\nf. I didn''t have to spend time distracted with compatibility issues\ng. I didn''t have to spend time with software installations nor configuration\nInfrastructure:\na. Servers are always up\nb. Web and courses are always available 24x7\nc. I''ve never had any issues accessing the web or courses\nd. I''ve never lost any work, all course work is saved and persistent\ne. Even if you navigate away from page and come back, your work is still there\nQuality:\na. The audio is very clear\nb. The video is very clear, bright, crisp\nc. The courses, instruction, resources &amp; projects are best bar-none...\nSimply put, it takes money and Udacity has to pay someone:\na. to create web content\nb. to house their infrastructure\nc. support and maintain infrastructure\nd. for building to house their employees and Silicon Valley isn''t cheap...\nAll I can say is I''m truly grateful for the privilege and honor to learn from some of the best.\nWhile I know everyone''s financial situation is a very sensitive, personal and private matter and I can empathize with any and all who struggle day to day for the bare minimum to eke out a living...   That doesn''t change the fact that:  Udacity is doing a Superb and Phenomenal job.\nBe grateful the courses and all the material is free.\nIf one can''t afford the Certificate, then again, be grateful for all the knowledge gained.\nUse that knowledge, make some money, then come back and pay for that certificate.\nHold one''s head up no matter what situation or station you find yourself in.\nNever give up, Never give in, Never quit...\nKnowledge is power.  Knowledge creates opportunities, enables options and provides choices.\nAnd Udacity is offering that " knowledge ",  wisdom and experience for " free ".\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~', '27 Feb, 21:52', 1),
